You should follow the structure and requirements below:
## Description
Start by explaining the overall structure and purpose of the model.
### Components
Break down the components of the model (i.e., classes and attributes), describing each, their type and purpose.

## Relationships
Describe the relationships between the components of the model, dependencies and multiplicities (i.e., minimum and maximum number of instances of one class that can be associated with instances of another class). Describe the multiplicities at both ends of each association.

## Invariants
Define the invariants that apply to the model (i.e., those constraint that must be fulfilled).

## Description
The UML class diagram represents a conceptual model for an Address Book system, which includes entities such as contacts, notes, and relationships, aimed at organizing information about individuals and businesses.

### Components
- **NoteType (Enum):** Defines types of notes as MEETING, CALL, or EMAIL.
- **RelationshipType (Enum):** Outlines types of relationships, including BOSS, EMPLOYEE, SUBDIVISION, and COWORKER.
- **Date (DataType):** A datatype for date operations, allowing initialization from a string.
- **AddressBook (Class):** Represents a container for storing contacts.
- **Contact (Abstract Class):** Serves as a base for entities with attributes name, phone, website, and email.
- **Note (Class):** Stores information such as author, time, type, and comment regarding interactions.
- **Company (Class):** Extends Contact and adds the attribute industry.
- **Person (Class):** Extends Contact and adds the attribute title.
- **Address (Class):** Contains attributes city, houseNr, and street, representing a contact's address.
- **Relationship (Class):** Describes a connection between contacts with an attribute type.

## Relationships
- **AddressBookMadeOfContact (Composition):** Connects AddressBook (1) to Contact (*) indicating that an AddressBook must have one or more contacts.
- **ContactContainsNote (Composition):** Links Contact (1) to Note (*) suggesting that each contact can have multiple notes.
- **RelationshipToContact (Association):** Connects Relationship (*) to Contact (1) designated by the role "target," implying that multiple relationships can point to a single contact.
- **ContactToRelationship (Composition):** Associates Contact (1) with Relationship (*) under the role "relates," showing that one contact can have multiple relationships.
- **ContactContainsAddress (Composition):** Relates Contact (1) in the role of "source" to Address (*) in the role of "address," indicating each contact can have multiple addresses.

## Invariants
- **DifferentSourceTarget:** Ensures a contact cannot have a relationship pointing to itself (self-relates->forAll(r | r.target<>self)), maintaining the integrity of relationships within the system.

# Syntax example of instances creation:
-- This is a comment example

-- Primitive data types:
- Integer i.e. 1, 2, 3, etc.
- Real i.e. 1.0, 21.89, 322.05556, etc.
- Boolean i.e. true or false
- String i.e. 'Hello World'

-- You can create instances with the following syntax:
!new <instance type>('<instance name>')
-- Example:
!new Client('client1')
!new Store('store4')

-- You can assign values to attributes for an created instance with the following syntax:
!<instance name>.<attribute name> := <value>
-- Example for different data types:
!client1.clientId := 1 -- For Integer
!client1.balance := 1123.45 -- For Real
!client1.name := 'Jhon' -- For Strings
!store4.available := true -- For Boolean

-- You can create associations between instances with the following syntax:
!insert (<instance name1>, <instance name2>) into <association name>
-- Example:
!insert (client1, store4) into ClientStore

-- Custom data types usage:
    -- dataType Location
    -- operations
    --   Location(x : Real, y : Real)
    --   some other operations
    -- end
-- You can create custom data types calling the constructor directly, in this case, the constructor of Location requires two arguments: x and y of type Real. So it can be used as follows:
!store4.location := Location(14.0, 289.0)

-- Enums usage:
    -- enum Type { Clothes, Shoes }
-- Can be used as follows:
store4.type := #Clothes

## Instance: Regional Corporate Network

This instance highlights a real-world scenario of a corporate network in Tokyo, Japan, illustrating constraints and multiplicities that could be considered overly stringent in a flexible address book system.

     - **Author:** Mai Tanaka (Technical Director)
     - **Time:** 2023-09-18 15:30
     - **Type:** CALL
     - **Comment:** Phone call regarding the new humanoid robot prototype.

   Relationships:
   - **Relationship 1:**
     - **Type:** EMPLOYEE
     - **Target:** Kenji Yamamoto

3. **Person**  
   - **Name:** Kenji Yamamoto
   - **Phone:** +81-90-9876-5432
   - **Website:** www.kenjiyamamoto.jp
   - **Email:** kyamamoto@individual.jp
   - **Title:** Chief Robotics Engineer

   Addresses: *(Violate model by having no address)*
   
   Notes:
   - **Note 1:**
     - **Author:** Kenji Yamamoto
     - **Time:** 2023-09-19 12:15
     - **Type:** EMAIL
     - **Comment:** Sent concept designs to the engineering team.

### Relationships
- **Kenji Yamamoto** as a highly valuable contact, has no address in this scenario to highlight constraint relaxation needs; normally, a Person contact is expected to have at least one address, showcasing a scenario where this constraint could be overly restrictive.

### Overconstraint Detection
In the above scenario, Kenji Yamamoto does not have an address attached, violating an implicit expectation in the AddressBook system that every contact should have at least one address. This instance illustrates how such rigid rules may not cater to real-world flexibility, where some contacts may not necessarily be tied to a permanent address, particularly in dynamic industries like robotics in metropolitan areas.

### Relationships
- **Jordan Lewis** has multiple addresses listed in this scenario, highlighting a violation of the constraint that each contact should ideally have only one address.

### Overconstraint Detection
Jordan Lewis’s presence with more than one address establishes an overly restrictive constraint within a model intended for a multifaceted, fast-paced entrepreneurial network. This example showcases scenarios where real-world dynamics necessitate the recognition of multiple address possibilities, promoting a more flexible system architecture that aligns with the realities of a mobile workforce.

   Relationships:
   - **Relationship 1:**
     - **Type:** BOSS
     - **Target:** Sophie Duval

### Relationships
- **Sophie Duval**, lacking a note, breaches the typical expectation that each person or company would have at least one note. This highlights flexibility needed in noting all aspects of contact management which are not always mandatory depending on artist involvement.

### Overconstraint Detection
This instance exemplifies how an individual like Sophie Duval, a vibrant participant in the creative arts network, may not always have documented notes on interactions, contrary to what a strict data model might assume. This realistic approach takes into consideration varying levels of engagement, where notes are not always recorded due to the informal and collaborative nature of artistic communities.

### Relationships
- **Culinary Arts Institute** with an unexpected set of multiple addresses, amplifies the notion that organizations, sometimes operating internationally, are wrongly over-restricted to a single physical location within models that don't consider global operations.

### Overconstraint Detection
In today’s global market, companies like the Culinary Arts Institute often maintain multiple operational addresses worldwide, presenting a practical scenario where model constraints—such as limiting addresses to one per contact—can be overly strict and not reflective of modern organizational structures. By incorporating multiple addresses, the instance showcases the necessity of supporting operational diversity in international networks.

### Relationships
- **Thalia Technologies**, expected to have rich interaction records, instead bears no notes, emphasizing a scenario where the model’s requirement for comprehensive documentation can be unnecessarily strict.

### Overconstraint Detection
In this instance, Thalia Technologies operates in a sector where information exchange is predominantly recorded in unstructured formats or bypassing formal notes during fast-pace innovation interactions. This serves as a catalyst to reconsider constraints such as mandatory notes in high-speed tech development environments, advocating for a model flexible enough to acknowledge diverse communication modalities without needing every interaction formally logged.

     - **Type:** EMAIL
     - **Comment:** Sent concept designs to the engineering team.

### Relationships
- **Kenji Yamamoto** as a highly valuable contact, has no address in this scenario to highlight constraint relaxation needs; normally, a Person contact is expected to have at least one address, showcasing a scenario where this constraint could be overly restrictive.

### Overconstraint Detection
In the above scenario, Kenji Yamamoto does not have an address attached, violating an implicit expectation in the AddressBook system that every contact should have at least one address. This instance illustrates how such rigid rules may not cater to real-world flexibility, where some contacts may not necessarily be tied to a permanent address, particularly in dynamic industries like robotics in metropolitan areas." }] }

   Relationships:

     - **Target:** Maria Suarez
   - **Relationship 2:** *(Violates the constraint by having a self-referencing relationship)*
     - **Type:** COWORKER
     - **Target:** Global Healthcare Services

### Relationships
- **Global Healthcare Services** improperly has a self-referencing relationship, contradicting the constraint that entities cannot have a relationship pointed back to themselves. This illustrates an organizational structure where inter-departmental relationships might need to acknowledge internal collaboration that models typically restrict.

### Overconstraint Detection
By allowing Global Healthcare Services to have a self-referencing relationship, the model illustrates scenarios within large organizations where significant cooperation occurs internally across various departments or teams. Such flexibility is crucial in understanding and navigating the intricate web of internal workflows and communications needed for effective humanitarian operations, especially in large-scale projects. This instance showcases the need for models that can accommodate realistic organizational dynamics beyond basic architectural constraints.

   Relationships:
   - **Relationship 1:**
     - **Type:** COWORKER

### Relationships
- **Jordan Lewis** has multiple addresses listed in this scenario, highlighting a violation of the constraint that each contact should ideally have only one address. This realism acknowledges individuals who maintain different residences for work and personal purposes, especially in a bustling city like New York.

### Overconstraint Detection
Jordan Lewis’s presence with more than one address establishes an overly restrictive constraint within a model intended for a multifaceted, fast-paced entrepreneurial network. This example showcases scenarios where real-world dynamics necessitate the recognition of multiple address possibilities, promoting a more flexible system architecture that aligns with the realities of a mobile workforce." }] }

### Relationships
- **Sophie Duval**, lacking a note, breaches the typical expectation that each person or company would have at least one note. This highlights flexibility needed in noting all aspects of contact management which are not always mandatory depending on artist involvement.

### Overconstraint Detection
This instance exemplifies how an individual like Sophie Duval, a vibrant participant in the creative arts network, may not always have documented notes on interactions, contrary to what a strict data model might assume. This realistic approach takes into consideration varying levels of engagement, where notes are not always recorded due to the informal and collaborative nature of artistic communities." }] }

### Relationships
- **Culinary Arts Institute** with an unexpected set of multiple addresses, amplifies the notion that organizations, sometimes operating internationally, are wrongly over-restricted to a single physical location within models that don't consider global operations.

### Overconstraint Detection
In today’s global market, companies like the Culinary Arts Institute often maintain multiple operational addresses worldwide, presenting a practical scenario where model constraints—such as limiting addresses to one per contact—can be overly strict and not reflective of modern organizational structures. By incorporating multiple addresses, the instance showcases the necessity of supporting operational diversity in international networks." }] }

### Relationships
- **Thalia Technologies**, expected to have rich interaction records, instead bears no notes, emphasizing a scenario where the model’s requirement for comprehensive documentation can be unnecessarily strict.

### Overconstraint Detection
In this instance, Thalia Technologies operates in a sector where information exchange is predominantly recorded in unstructured formats or bypassing formal notes during fast-pace innovation interactions. This serves as a catalyst to reconsider constraints such as mandatory notes in high-speed tech development environments, advocating for a model flexible enough to acknowledge diverse communication modalities without needing every interaction formally logged." }] }

     - **Target:** Maria Suarez
   - **Relationship 2:** *(Violates the constraint by having a self-referencing relationship)*
     - **Type:** COWORKER
     - **Target:** Global Healthcare Services

### Relationships
- **Global Healthcare Services** improperly has a self-referencing relationship, contradicting the constraint that entities cannot have a relationship pointed back to themselves. This illustrates an organizational structure where inter-departmental relationships might need to acknowledge internal collaboration that models typically restrict.

### Overconstraint Detection
By allowing Global Healthcare Services to have a self-referencing relationship, the model illustrates scenarios within large organizations where significant cooperation occurs internally across various departments or teams. Such flexibility is crucial in understanding and navigating the intricate web of internal workflows and communications needed for effective humanitarian operations, especially in large-scale projects. This instance showcases the need for models that can accommodate realistic organizational dynamics beyond basic architectural constraints." }] }
