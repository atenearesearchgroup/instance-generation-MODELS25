## Description
The "VideoClub" model is designed to represent the structure and operations of a video rental system. It includes entities such as clients, rentals, cassettes, movies, series, and actors. The purpose of this model is to manage and track the rental activities within a video club, including the relationships between clients, rentals, and cassette items, as well as the involvement of actors in those cassettes.

### Components
- **DataType Date**: A data type with an operation to initialize the date from a string format.
- **Enum Genre**: An enumeration defining two movie genres: Action and Comedy.
- **Class Client**: Represents clients of the video club with two attributes:
  - `clientId`: Integer, unique identifier for the client.
  - `isSuspended`: Boolean, indicating the suspension status of the client.
- **Class Rental**: Represents the rental activity with one attribute:
  - `date`: Date of the rental transaction.
- **Class Cassette**: Acts as a base class for items available for rent, with two attributes:
  - `title`: String, name of the cassette.
  - `availableCopies`: Integer, indicating how many copies are available.
- **Class Movie**: Inherits from Cassette and includes an additional attribute:
  - `genre`: Genre, represents the type of movie.
- **Class Series**: Inherits from Cassette and includes an additional attribute:
  - `episode`: Integer, represents the episode number of the series.
- **Class Actor**: Represents actors with one attribute:
  - `name`: String, the name of the actor.

## Relationships
- **ClientRental Association**: Connects `Client` and `Rental`.
  - Multiplicity: 
    - Client end: [1] - Each client can be linked to one or more rentals.
    - Rental end: [*] - Each rental must be linked to exactly one client.
- **RentalCassette Association**: Connects `Rental` and `Cassette`.
  - Multiplicity: 
    - Rental end: [*] - Each rental can involve one or more cassettes.
    - Cassette end: [1..*] - Each cassette can be involved in multiple rentals.
- **CassetteActor Association**: Connects `Cassette` and `Actor`.
  - Multiplicity:
    - Cassette end: [*] - Each cassette can involve one or more actors.
    - Actor end: [1..*] - Each actor must be linked to at least one cassette.

## Invariants
- **Client Invariant (`positiveClientId`)**: Ensures that `clientId` for each client is greater than 0.
- **Cassette Invariant (`postiveAvailableCopies`)**: Ensures that `availableCopies` is greater than or equal to 0.
- **Series Invariant (`positiveEpisode`)**: Ensures that `episode` for a series is greater than 0.

# Syntax example of instances creation:
-- This is a comment example

-- Primitive data types:
- Integer i.e. 1, 2, 3, etc.
- Real i.e. 1.0, 21.89, 322.05556, etc.
- Boolean i.e. true or false
- String i.e. 'Hello World'

-- You can create instances with the following syntax:
!new <instance type>('<instance name>')
-- Example:
!new Client('client1')
!new Store('store4')

-- You can assign values to attributes for an created instance with the following syntax:
!<instance name>.<attribute name> := <value>
-- Example for different data types:
!client1.clientId := 1 -- For Integer
!client1.balance := 1123.45 -- For Real
!client1.name := 'Jhon' -- For Strings
!store4.available := true -- For Boolean

-- You can create associations between instances with the following syntax:
!insert (<instance name1>, <instance name2>) into <association name>
-- Example:
!insert (client1, store4) into ClientStore

-- Custom data types usage:
    -- dataType Location
    -- operations
    --   Location(x : Real, y : Real)

-- You can create custom data types calling the constructor directly, in this case, the constructor of Location requires two arguments: x and y of type Real. So it can be used as follows:
!store4.location := Location(14.0, 289.0)

-- Enums usage:
    -- enum Type { Clothes, Shoes }
-- Can be used as follows:
store4.type := #Clothes

- **Rarity with One Available Copy**: The movie "The Only Copy" has only one available copy, making it a rare item, which could simulate a world where physical copies are almost extinct.
- **Zero Available Copy Series**: The "Single Episode Saga" series has 0 available copies currently, possibly due to being entirely rented out, reflecting a situation where demand greatly exceeds the supply.
- **Multiple Rentals of Same Cassette**: The same Cassette is involved in multiple rentals occurring very close in timeframe, indicating high demand or a strategic last-minute rental spree by a single client.
- **Multiple Actors, Few Cassettes**: There are more actors than cassettes, highlighting a scenario where several talents are associated with extremely rare or few physical media items in circulation.
- **Non-suspended Client With Unusual Multiple Rentals**: The client remains unsuspended despite extensive rental activity, suggesting a very active user who keeps returning items in a timely fashion.

# Instance: Cultural Film Fest Video Club

## Context Description
The Cultural Film Fest Video Club, situated in the heart of a multicultural neighborhood in Toronto, specializes in cultural films and series from around the world. The club emphasizes global cinema and serial content, providing unique opportunities to explore varied cultures through film. This instance aims to expose a scenario where the current model restrictions unintentionally limit realistic operations in a culturally vibrant setting.

### Entities

#### Clients
1. **Client: Maria Alvarez**
   - `clientId`: 203
   - `isSuspended`: False
   - Note: Maria loves exploring films from all over the world, with a keen interest in Spanish cinema.

2. **Client: Zhang Wei**
   - `clientId`: 204
   - `isSuspended`: False
   - Note: Wei is an enthusiast of martial arts films and often rents series that include thrilling action sequences.

#### Rentals
1. **Rental: Toronto International Evening**
   - `date`: 2023-09-15
   - Linked to Client: Maria Alvarez
   - Linked Cassettes:
     - "Almodóvar Masterpieces" Series
     - "Jackie Chan's Classics" Movie
   - Issue: The rental includes two cassettes, violating the model by indicating multiplicity on the rental end where this situation is common in cultural contexts.

2. **Rental: Cultural Discoveries**
   - `date`: 2023-09-20
   - Linked to Client: Zhang Wei
   - Linked Cassettes:
     - "Jackie Chan's Classics" Movie
     - "Cultural Series: Volume 1" Series

#### Cassettes
1. **Cassette (Series): Almodóvar Masterpieces**
   - `title`: "Almodóvar Masterpieces"
   - `availableCopies`: 5
   - `episode`: 3

2. **Cassette (Movie): Jackie Chan's Classics**
   - `title`: "Jackie Chan's Classics"
   - `availableCopies`: 2
   - `genre`: Action

3. **Cassette (Series): Cultural Series: Volume 1**
   - `title`: "Cultural Series: Volume 1"
   - `availableCopies`: 3
   - `episode`: 1

#### Actors
1. **Actor: Penélope Cruz**
   - `name`: "Penélope Cruz"
   - Linked to Cassette: "Almodóvar Masterpieces"

2. **Actor: Jackie Chan**
   - `name`: "Jackie Chan"
   - Linked to Cassette: "Jackie Chan's Classics"

3. **Actor: Various Artists**
   - `name`: "Various Artists"
   - Linked to Cassette: "Cultural Series: Volume 1"

### Relationship Violation and Justification
- **RentalCassette Association Violation**: The instance for "Toronto International Evening" rental includes two cassettes, "Almodóvar Masterpieces" and "Jackie Chan's Classics." This represents a realistic scenario in which clients rent multiple culturally themed cassettes at once, illustrating an undue constraint in the model's current setting, which might not allow such flexibility per a single transaction.
  
- **Cultural Diversity Exploration**: Such scenarios demonstrate the diverse interests and the embracing of multicultural content that clients engage in, which should be feasibly supported, yet it's over-restricted by the existing model constraints, suggesting a need for allowing multiple cassettes per rental relationship without restrictions.

This instance captures how real-world scenarios, specifically in multicultural settings, may involve multiple cassettes per rental transaction, where libraries aim to provide a blend of materials, breaking away from overconstraints found in model interpretations.

   - Linked to Cassette: "Jackie Chan's Classics"

3. **Actor: Various Artists**
   - `name`: "Various Artists"
   - Linked to Cassette: "Cultural Series: Volume 1"

### Relationship Violation and Justification
- **RentalCassette Association Violation**: The instance for "Toronto International Evening" rental includes two cassettes, "Almodóvar Masterpieces" and "Jackie Chan's Classics." This represents a realistic scenario in which clients rent multiple culturally themed cassettes at once, illustrating an undue constraint in the model's current setting, which might not allow such flexibility per a single transaction.
  
- **Cultural Diversity Exploration**: Such scenarios demonstrate the diverse interests and the embracing of multicultural content that clients engage in, which should be feasibly supported, yet it's over-restricted by the existing model constraints, suggesting a need for allowing multiple cassettes per rental relationship without restrictions.

This instance captures how real-world scenarios, specifically in multicultural settings, may involve multiple cassettes per rental transaction, where libraries aim to provide a blend of materials, breaking away from overconstraints found in model interpretations." }] }

   - **Associated Actors**: Actor 10

4. **Actor**
   - `name`: "Ryan Reynolds"

### Scenarios Highlighted in this Edge Instance:
- **Multiple Clients with Overlapping Rentals**: Clients are engaged in an overlapping web of rentals, sharing some cassettes over a short period, indicating simultaneous interests or shared events like a movie night.
- **Zero and Limited Availability**: "Director’s Vision" has zero available copies, while "Epic Conclusion" has only one, generating a situation where demand could exceed immediate supply.
- **Rare Actor Collaboration**: Featuring heavyweight actors like Cate Blanchett and Denzel Washington, this instance involves movies with high artistic interest, potentially explaining the overlapping demand.
- **Multi-Genre Rental Strategy**: "Evening Laughs" being rented alongside non-comedy cassettes suggests a strategy to balance watching experiences with different moods in a short span.
- **Diverse Customer Engagement**: All clients are unsuspended, which might represent a particularly well-managed clientele or temporary promotions attracting responsible customers.

This instance reflects complex interactions and trends, portraying a video club where high-demand items are strategically shared amongst discerning clients, exemplifying a high turnover yet limited inventory scenario.

### Relationship Violation and Justification
- **RentalCassette Association Violation**: Highlighted by "São Paulo Saturday Showcase," this rental involved both a series and a movie, depicting a common practice in vibrant community spaces where patrons frequent to exploit diverse entertainment offerings.

- **Cassette Invariant Violation**: The "Brazilian Classics: The Golden Age" series violates the model constraint with `availableCopies` at 0, reflecting a realistic scenario of constant demand and indicating an oversight regarding availability in culturally rich environments.

- **Client Considerations**: Ana de Souza's involvement despite suspension suggests operational model flexibility, where community member scenarios aren't as rigidly bound as modeled—exemplifying local interpretations of community engagement protocols.

This instance dissects model limitations in multicultural and communal settings, prompting considerations for policy block flexibility, availability forecasting, and community practice enlightenment that extend beyond existing constraints.

- **Cult Classics and Limited Releases**: The "Timeless Adventure" is a zero-available classic, while "Laughing Matters" remains crucial with its limited release uniqueness. Each is sought after differently, straddling timelessness and niche appeal.
- **Episode-based Complexity in Series**: Series like "Twilight Tales" and "Tomorrow's Quest" emphasize futuristic narratives and The Collector's Conundrum, enticing intense user interest despite their complexity and scarcity in available copies.
- **Eclectic Actor Involvement**: Renowned actors from diverse genres highlight the specialized appeal of these cassettes, balancing humor, high drama, and science fiction with shared celebrity presence.
- **Unusual Rent and Suspend Scenario**: Despite a suspension (Client 401), active, high-stake rental orders, primarily involving rare or no availability cassettes, convey relationship intricacies between rule compliance and collector passion.

This instance showcases an exceptional blend of scarcity, cult interest, and client choice factors, enriching the understanding of complex interpersonal and preference-driven operations within a video club setting.

### Relationship Violation and Justification
- **RentalCassette Association Violation**: The "Weekend Cinema Night" rental transaction involves both the "Samurai Stories" series and "Modern Japanese Comedy" film, reflecting a usual but currently unhandled scenario where loyal clients savor a multitude of cinematic experiences simultaneously.

- **Structural Diversity**: This emphasizes the necessity for the model to support multiple cassettes per rental in a culturally diverse environment where patrons naturally select more than one title to fit various thematic and emotional experiences.

- **Semantic Diversity**: By incorporating a mix of cultural entities focusing on both series and comedic films, this instance underscores not only the diversity in client expectations but also presents a case for expanding model flexibility to accommodate practical client behaviors within such an engaging and varied cultural retail setting.

This instance highlights real-world transaction patterns among cultured clients who might favor multiple rentals, showcasing how the model can assess and possibly accommodate these richer, more intricate interactions." }] }

   - Linked Cassettes:
     - "Walkabout Wonders" Series
     - "Outback Safari Adventures" Movie
     - "Wild Frontier: Cowboys" Movie

   - Linked to Client: Jasmine Ming
   - Linked Cassettes:
     - "Outback Safari Adventures" Movie

   - Linked to Cassette: "Wild Frontier: Cowboys"

### Relationship Violation and Justification
- **RentalCassette Association Violation**: Liam's "Adventure Lands Collection" creates a scenario where multiple movies and a series are rented simultaneously. This is typical for such an isolated locale where residents commonly plan multifaceted movie nights in community gatherings, conflicting with model expectations of singular cassette limitations per relationship.
  
- **Semantic Exploration**: The model constraints do not accommodate the reality of logistical and personal preferences shaping outback life, like extended rentals for anticipated entertainment constraints and community movie gatherings.

- **Accessibility Challenges**: Limited availability of "Outback Safari Adventures" further identifies the realistic obstacle outback clubs face, pushing for allowance beyond modeled availability constraints to ensure managerial fluidity in unique environmental and customer-driven settings.

This instance reveals broader operational realities necessitating thoughtful revising of model constraints, aiming to align with multifaceted access needs and culturally-incorporated experiences in remote, unique, and conservation-aware settings.

   - Linked to Client: Elina Koivisto
   - Linked Cassettes:
     - "Frozen Shadows: Crime Series" Series
     - "Midsummer Laughs" Movie
   - Note: Elina combines a crime drama series with a comedy movie, turning a model-overlooked practice into a communal norm, particularly during the holiday season.

2. **Rental: Nordic Cinema Night**
   - `date`: 2023-11-20
   - Linked to Client: Johan Nielsen
   - Linked Cassettes:
     - "Nordic Noir Masterpieces" Series

### Relationship Violation and Justification
- **RentalCassette Association Violation**: In the "Arctic Mystery Bundle," Elina rented both a series and a movie simultaneously, indicating a common practice where film clubs aim to provide variety for patron engagements over cold seasons, contrary to the model limitations.

- **Cassette Invariant Violation**: The "Midsummer Laughs" movie is currently out of stock, yet is linked within a rental transaction. This mirrors real life where demand spikes during cultural celebrations, clashing with model constraints related to assumed availability at rental time.

- **Suspension and Community Dynamics**: Johan's suspension over delayed returns echoes typical community practices of shared rentals, advocating a model revision to consider client interactions and shared user burdens within close-knit cultural environments.

This instance underscores how model constraints limiting simultaneous multiple rentals or ignored availability challenges aren't reflective of everyday practices. It suggests adjusting parameters to account for cultural and seasonal influences on video rental behaviors, particularly in environments celebrated for their distinctive storytelling and cinematic appreciation.

### Edge Case Instance: The Unexpected Overlap

#### Clients
1. **Client**
   - `clientId`: 200
   - `isSuspended`: False

2. **Client**
   - `clientId`: 201
   - `isSuspended`: False

3. **Client**
   - `clientId`: 202
   - `isSuspended`: False

#### Rentals
1. **Rental**
   - `date`: Initialized from "2023-09-15"
   - **Associated Client**: Client 200

3. **Rental**
   - `date`: Initialized from "2023-09-17"
   - **Associated Client**: Client 202
   - **Associated Cassettes**: Cassette 6, Cassette 8

#### Cassettes
1. **Cassette—Movie** (rare director’s cut needing actor attention)
   - `title`: "Director’s Vision"
   - `availableCopies`: 0
   - `genre`: Action
   - **Associated Rentals**: Rental 1
   - **Associated Actors**: Actor 8, Actor 9

2. **Cassette—Series** (closing a series yet involving high cross-client rental)
   - `title`: "Epic Conclusion"
   - `availableCopies`: 1
   - `episode`: 30
   - **Associated Rentals**: Rental 1, Rental 2
   - **Associated Actors**: Actor 10

3. **Cassette—Movie** (a dual rental situation promoting comedy nights)
   - `title`: "Evening Laughs"
   - `availableCopies`: 2
   - `genre`: Comedy
   - **Associated Rentals**: Rental 2, Rental 3
   - **Associated Actors**: Actor 11

   - `name`: "Emma Watson"
   - **Associated Cassettes**: Cassette 7

4. **Actor**
   - `name`: "Ryan Reynolds"
   - **Associated Cassettes**: Cassette 8

### Scenarios Highlighted in this Edge Instance:
- **Multiple Clients with Overlapping Rentals**: Clients are engaged in an overlapping web of rentals, sharing some cassettes over a short period, indicating simultaneous interests or shared events like a movie night.
- **Zero and Limited Availability**: "Director’s Vision" has zero available copies, while "Epic Conclusion" has only one, generating a situation where demand could exceed immediate supply.
- **Rare Actor Collaboration**: Featuring heavyweight actors like Cate Blanchett and Denzel Washington, this instance involves movies with high artistic interest, potentially explaining the overlapping demand.
- **Multi-Genre Rental Strategy**: "Evening Laughs" being rented alongside non-comedy cassettes suggests a strategy to balance watching experiences with different moods in a short span.
- **Diverse Customer Engagement**: All clients are unsuspended, which might represent a particularly well-managed clientele or temporary promotions attracting responsible customers.

This instance reflects complex interactions and trends, portraying a video club where high-demand items are strategically shared amongst discerning clients, exemplifying a high turnover yet limited inventory scenario." }] }

### Relationship Violation and Justification
- **RentalCassette Association Violation**: Priya’s "Classic Bollywood Night" involved multiple cassettes, underscoring community viewing traditions prevalent in India where personal gatherings embrace diverse cinematic experiences, contrasting the model's single-item vision.

- **Cultural Practice Insight**: Culturally engaged rentals frequently mix elements from different genres and formats, pushing the structural boundaries of a fixed rental association, thus capturing the clients’ desire for multi-dimensional, shared cinematic narratives beyond rigid restriction.

This instance accentuates the vibrant characteristics of the Bollywood viewing culture, advocating for enhanced model flexibility to embrace complex, culturally expansive interactions regularly encountered within Indian film appreciation and communal watching practices.

### Relationship Violation and Justification
- **RentalCassette Association Violation**: Highlighted by "São Paulo Saturday Showcase," this rental involved both a series and a movie, depicting a common practice in vibrant community spaces where patrons frequent to exploit diverse entertainment offerings.

- **Cassette Invariant Violation**: The "Brazilian Classics: The Golden Age" series violates the model constraint with `availableCopies` at 0, reflecting a realistic scenario of constant demand and indicating an oversight regarding availability in culturally rich environments.

- **Client Considerations**: Ana de Souza's involvement despite suspension suggests operational model flexibility, where community member scenarios aren't as rigidly bound as modeled—exemplifying local interpretations of community engagement protocols.

This instance dissects model limitations in multicultural and communal settings, prompting considerations for policy block flexibility, availability forecasting, and community practice enlightenment that extend beyond existing constraints." }] }

- **Cult Classics and Limited Releases**: The "Timeless Adventure" is a zero-available classic, while "Laughing Matters" remains crucial with its limited release uniqueness. Each is sought after differently, straddling timelessness and niche appeal.
- **Episode-based Complexity in Series**: Series like "Twilight Tales" and "Tomorrow's Quest" emphasize futuristic narratives and The Collector's Conundrum, enticing intense user interest despite their complexity and scarcity in available copies.
- **Eclectic Actor Involvement**: Renowned actors from diverse genres highlight the specialized appeal of these cassettes, balancing humor, high drama, and science fiction with shared celebrity presence.
- **Unusual Rent and Suspend Scenario**: Despite a suspension (Client 401), active, high-stake rental orders, primarily involving rare or no availability cassettes, convey relationship intricacies between rule compliance and collector passion.

This instance showcases an exceptional blend of scarcity, cult interest, and client choice factors, enriching the understanding of complex interpersonal and preference-driven operations within a video club setting." }] }

# Instance: Outback Classics Video Club

## Context Description
Outback Classics Video Club is located in Alice Springs, Australia, amidst the beautiful and remote landscapes of the Northern Territory. Known for catering to films that celebrate the outback spirit, this club emphasizes the rugged, adventurous, and picturesque qualities of Australian cinema and international cowboy and wilderness adventures. The unique lifestyle and remote locale influence the club's operations, especially concerning inventory availability and client interactions.

### Entities

#### Clients
1. **Client: Liam O'Connor**
   - `clientId`: 740

2. **Client: Jasmine Ming**
   - `clientId`: 741
   - `isSuspended`: False
   - Note: Jasmine is interested in outback-themed series that capture Australia’s diverse ecosystems and wildlife documentation.

#### Rentals
1. **Rental: Adventure Lands Collection**
   - `date`: 2023-07-22
   - Linked to Client: Liam O'Connor
   - Linked Cassettes:
     - "Walkabout Wonders" Series
     - "Outback Safari Adventures" Movie
     - "Wild Frontier: Cowboys" Movie
   - Note: Liam's enthusiasm for adventure lands combines series and multiple movies, uncovering model limitations in a single rental transaction, a common practice due to the club’s remote setting and communal planning.

2. **Rental: Desert Mirage Special**
   - `date`: 2023-08-05
   - Linked to Client: Jasmine Ming
   - Linked Cassettes:
     - "Outback Safari Adventures" Movie
   - Note: Jasmine's appreciation for the cinematic portrayal of the outback showcases targeted selections within genre constraints.

#### Cassettes
1. **Cassette (Series): Walkabout Wonders**
   - `title`: "Walkabout Wonders"
   - `availableCopies`: 8
   - `episode`: 10
   - Note: Celebrates Aboriginal culture and historic exploration carrying educational significance.

2. **Cassette (Movie): Outback Safari Adventures**
   - `title`: "Outback Safari Adventures"
   - `availableCopies`: 1
   - `genre`: Action
   - Note: A quintessential representation of outback life, this feature film is a preferred choice for both wildlife enthusiasts and action seekers.

3. **Cassette (Movie): Wild Frontier: Cowboys**

   - Linked to Cassette: "Wild Frontier: Cowboys"
   - Note: His classic portrayals of rugged western roles transcend geographical boundaries, influencing rugged lifestyle films worldwide.

### Relationship Violation and Justification
- **RentalCassette Association Violation**: Liam's "Adventure Lands Collection" creates a scenario where multiple movies and a series are rented simultaneously. This is typical for such an isolated locale where residents commonly plan multifaceted movie nights in community gatherings, conflicting with model expectations of singular cassette limitations per relationship.
  
- **Semantic Exploration**: The model constraints do not accommodate the reality of logistical and personal preferences shaping outback life, like extended rentals for anticipated entertainment constraints and community movie gatherings.

- **Accessibility Challenges**: Limited availability of "Outback Safari Adventures" further identifies the realistic obstacle outback clubs face, pushing for allowance beyond modeled availability constraints to ensure managerial fluidity in unique environmental and customer-driven settings.

This instance reveals broader operational realities necessitating thoughtful revising of model constraints, aiming to align with multifaceted access needs and culturally-incorporated experiences in remote, unique, and conservation-aware settings." }] }

   - Linked Cassettes:
     - "Frozen Shadows: Crime Series" Series

2. **Rental: Nordic Cinema Night**

2. **Cassette (Movie): Midsummer Laughs**
   - `title`: "Midsummer Laughs"
   - `availableCopies`: 0
   - `genre`: Comedy
   - Note: Extremely popular during solstice celebrations, this comedy's unavailability is a recurring issue, contradicting player requirements for each rental.

   - Linked to Cassette: "Nordic Noir Masterpieces"
   - Note: Renowned for embodying compelling roles that resonate deeply within the genre of thriller and noir.

### Relationship Violation and Justification
- **RentalCassette Association Violation**: In the "Arctic Mystery Bundle," Elina rented both a series and a movie simultaneously, indicating a common practice where film clubs aim to provide variety for patron engagements over cold seasons, contrary to the model limitations.

- **Cassette Invariant Violation**: The "Midsummer Laughs" movie is currently out of stock, yet is linked within a rental transaction. This mirrors real life where demand spikes during cultural celebrations, clashing with model constraints related to assumed availability at rental time.

- **Suspension and Community Dynamics**: Johan's suspension over delayed returns echoes typical community practices of shared rentals, advocating a model revision to consider client interactions and shared user burdens within close-knit cultural environments.

This instance underscores how model constraints limiting simultaneous multiple rentals or ignored availability challenges aren't reflective of everyday practices. It suggests adjusting parameters to account for cultural and seasonal influences on video rental behaviors, particularly in environments celebrated for their distinctive storytelling and cinematic appreciation." }] }
