Here is an example of the language syntax for creating instances:
-- This is a comment example

-- Primitive data types:
- Integer i.e. 1, 2, 3, etc.
- Real i.e. 1.0, 21.89, 322.05556, etc.
- Boolean i.e. true or false
- String i.e. 'Hello World'

-- You can create instances with the following syntax:
!new <instance type>('<instance name>')
-- Example:
!new Client('client1')
!new Store('store4')

-- You can assign values to attributes for an created instance with the following syntax:
!<instance name>.<attribute name> := <value>
-- Example for different data types:
!client1.clientId := 1 -- For Integer
!client1.balance := 1123.45 -- For Real
!client1.name := 'Jhon' -- For Strings
!store4.available := true -- For Boolean

-- You can create associations between instances with the following syntax:
!insert (<instance name1>, <instance name2>) into <association name>
-- Example:
!insert (client1, store4) into ClientStore

-- Custom data types usage:
    -- dataType Location
    -- operations
    --   Location(x : Real, y : Real)
    --   some other operations
    -- end
-- You can create custom data types calling the constructor directly, in this case, the constructor of Location requires two arguments: x and y of type Real. So it can be used as follows:
!store4.location := Location(14.0, 289.0)

-- Enums usage:
    -- enum Type { Clothes, Shoes }
-- Can be used as follows:
store4.type := #Clothes
" }] }
