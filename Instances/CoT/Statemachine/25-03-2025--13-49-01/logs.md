## Description
The model represents a state machine system, encapsulating states, state machines, transitions, and time events. Its purpose is to define how states and transitions interact within a state machine, incorporating timing logic through events.

### Components
1. **NamedElement (abstract class)**: 
   - Attributes: `name` of type `String`.
   - Purpose: A base class for elements with a name attribute.

2. **State (class)**: 
   - Inherits from `NamedElement`.
   - Purpose: Represents a state within a state machine.

3. **StateMachine (class)**: 
   - Inherits from `NamedElement`.
   - Purpose: Represents the state machine entity itself that contains states and transitions.

4. **Transition (class)**: 
   - Inherits from `NamedElement`.
   - Purpose: Represents a transition between states in a state machine.

5. **TimeEvent (class)**:
   - Attributes: `time` of type `Integer`.
   - Purpose: Represents an event triggered by a specific time value, associated with transitions.

## Relationships

1. **StateMachineContainsStates (composition)**:
   - Between: `StateMachine` [1] and `State` [0..*].
   - Purpose: Each state machine must contain one or more states.

2. **StateMachineStartsStates (association)**:
   - Between: `StateMachine` [0..1] and `State` [1].
   - Purpose: A state machine can optionally have one start state. Each start state is associated with exactly one state machine.

3. **StateMachineContainsTransitions (composition)**:
   - Between: `StateMachine` [1] and `Transition` [0..*].
   - Purpose: Each state machine can contain multiple transitions.

4. **TransitionContainsEvents (composition)**:
   - Between: `Transition` [1] and `TimeEvent` [1].
   - Purpose: Each transition must contain exactly one time event.

5. **StateTransition (association)**:
   - Between: `State` [1] and `Transition` [0..*].
   - Purpose: A state can have multiple outgoing transitions, but each outgoing transition is associated with exactly one source state.

6. **TransitionState (association)**:
   - Between: `Transition` [0..*] and `State` [1].
   - Purpose: A transition can lead to multiple states, but each target state is associated with exactly one incoming transition.

## Invariants

1. **TimeIsPositive**: 
   - Context: `TimeEvent`
   - Constraint: The `time` attribute must be greater than 0 for all TimeEvents.

2. **FirstCharLowerCase**:
   - Context: `StateMachine`
   - Constraint: The first character of every state's name within a state machine must be lowercase.

## Instance: MinimalStateMachine

### NamedElement Instances
1. **State:**
   - Name: `sleep`
   - Description: Represents a state where a system is inactive or in a rest mode.

2. **StateMachine:**
   - Name: `powerManagement`
   - Description: A state machine responsible for managing different power states of an electronic device.

3. **Transition:**
   - Name: `wakeTransition`
   - Description: A transition from the `sleep` state to an active state when an external event occurs.

4. **Transition:**
   - Name: `shutdownTransition`
   - Description: A transition from the `sleep` state to a shutdown state triggered by a scheduled event.

5. **TimeEvent:**
   - Time: 1
   - Description: A time event that triggers a transition to shutdown state exactly 1 minute after entering `sleep` state.

### Relationships and Composition

1. **StateMachineContainsStates (composition):**
   - StateMachine: `powerManagement`
   - States: 
     - `sleep` 

2. **StateMachineStartsStates (association):**
   - StateMachine: `powerManagement`
   - Start State: `sleep`

3. **StateMachineContainsTransitions (composition):**
   - StateMachine: `powerManagement`
   - Transitions: 
     - `wakeTransition`
     - `shutdownTransition`

4. **TransitionContainsEvents (composition):**
   - Transition: `shutdownTransition`
   - TimeEvent: Immediately triggers after 1 minute (Time: 1)

5. **StateTransition (association):**
   - Source State: `sleep`
   - Outgoing Transitions:
     - `wakeTransition`
     - `shutdownTransition`

6. **TransitionState (association):**
   - Transition: `wakeTransition`
   - Target State: "active" (Note: Though not listed in NamedElement Instances, it implies reaching an active state outside the context of this minimal example).
   
   - Transition: `shutdownTransition`
   - Target State: "shutdown" (Note: Similarly, this is transitional to another state not explicitly named in this instance but implied to comply with the concept).

### Explanation
- This instance exemplifies boundary constraints by demonstrating minimal yet essential elements required by the conceptual model. 
- The `StateMachineContainsStates` and `StateMachineContainsTransitions` are built with the minimum number of states and transitions.
- `TimeEvent` uses the minimum positive time allowed (as per "TimeIsPositive" invariant), illustrating constraints on time values.
- The starting state and one transition to enforce the lower boundary of the system's complexity while fulfilling all model invariants and relationships.
- Names such as `sleep` ensure the requirement that state names begin with a lowercase character is met, adhering to the `FirstCharLowerCase` constraint.

!new Client('client1')
!new Store('store4')

-- You can assign values to attributes for an created instance with the following syntax:
!<instance name>.<attribute name> := <value>
-- Example for different data types:
!client1.clientId := 1 -- For Integer
!client1.balance := 1123.45 -- For Real
!client1.name := 'Jhon' -- For Strings
!store4.available := true -- For Boolean

-- You can create associations between instances with the following syntax:
!insert (<instance name1>, <instance name2>) into <association name>
-- Example:
!insert (client1, store4) into ClientStore

-- Custom data types usage:
    -- dataType Location
    -- operations
    --   Location(x : Real, y : Real)
    --   some other operations
    -- end
-- You can create custom data types calling the constructor directly, in this case, the constructor of Location requires two arguments: x and y of type Real. So it can be used as follows:
!store4.location := Location(14.0, 289.0)

-- Enums usage:
    -- enum Type { Clothes, Shoes }
-- Can be used as follows:
store4.type := #Clothes

### Explanation
- This instance exemplifies boundary constraints by demonstrating minimal yet essential elements required by the conceptual model. 
- The `StateMachineContainsStates` and `StateMachineContainsTransitions` are built with the minimum number of states and transitions.
- `TimeEvent` uses the minimum positive time allowed (as per "TimeIsPositive" invariant), illustrating constraints on time values.
- The starting state and one transition to enforce the lower boundary of the system's complexity while fulfilling all model invariants and relationships.
- Names such as `sleep` ensure the requirement that state names begin with a lowercase character is met, adhering to the `FirstCharLowerCase` constraint.

## Instance: Home Security State Machine

### Entities

#### StateMachine
- **Name**: `homeSecuritySM`
- **Description**: This state machine controls the states of a home security system.

#### States
1. **State**:
   - **Name**: `armed`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `homeSecuritySM`

2. **State**:
   - **Name**: `disarmed`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `homeSecuritySM`

3. **State**:
   - **Name**: `triggered`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `homeSecuritySM`

#### Transitions
1. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `armToDisarm`
   - **Source State**: `armed`
   - **Target State**: `disarmed`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `homeSecuritySM`

2. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `disarmToTrigger`
   - **Source State**: `disarmed`
   - **Target State**: `triggered`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `homeSecuritySM`

3. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `triggerToArm`
   - **Source State**: `triggered`
   - **Target State**: `armed`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `homeSecuritySM`

#### TimeEvents
1. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 30
   - **Associated Transition**: `armToDisarm`

2. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: -15  *(!!! Constraint Violation: TimeIsPositive !!!)*
   - **Associated Transition**: `disarmToTrigger`

3. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 5
   - **Associated Transition**: `triggerToArm`

### Relationships Analysis

**StateMachineContainsStates**:
- The `homeSecuritySM` contains the states `armed`, `disarmed`, and `triggered`, fulfilling the composition requirement from `StateMachine` to `State`.

**StateMachineStartsStates**:
- The `homeSecuritySM` has no explicit start state defined, which is optional, aligning with the model.

**StateMachineContainsTransitions**:
- The `homeSecuritySM` operates the transitions `armToDisarm`, `disarmToTrigger`, and `triggerToArm`.

**TransitionContainsEvents**:
- Each transition (`armToDisarm`, `disarmToTrigger`, `triggerToArm`) has an associated `TimeEvent`, illustrating composition.

**StateTransition**:
- Each state (`armed`, `disarmed`, `triggered`) is correctly associated with its outgoing transitions.

**TransitionState**:
- Transitions connect appropriately to their target states, but note that the model's single incoming transition constraint is inherently brittle and may require relaxing in broader scenarios.

### Constraint Violation Analysis

- **TimeIsPositive**: The `disarmToTrigger` transition's `TimeEvent` with `time` set to `-15` violates the `TimeIsPositive` invariant. This exposes the rigidity of the model, necessitating consideration of scenario-based temporal flexibility (e.g., countdown before alarm trigger stop).

This example highlights a home security system, demonstrating valid operations yet showcasing problems in temporal flexibility and model restrictions such as negative timing for certain real-life scenarios like countdowns, hence detecting an overconstraint condition.

   - State 3:
     - Name: `returnToDock`
   
   - State 4:
     - Name: `charging`

3. **Transitions**

   - Transition 1:
     - Name: `startCleaning`
   
   - Transition 2:
     - Name: `finishCleaning`
   
   - Transition 3:
     - Name: `lowBattery`
   
   - Transition 4:
     - Name: `fullyCharged`

4. **TimeEvents**

   - TimeEvent for Transition 1:
     - Time: `5`
   
   - TimeEvent for Transition 2:
     - Time: `120`
   
   - TimeEvent for Transition 3:
     - Time: `10`
   
   - TimeEvent for Transition 4:
     - Time: `240`

#### Relationships and Structure

1. **StateMachineContainsStates**
   - The state machine `roboticVacuumControl` contains the states: `idleMode`, `cleanMode`, `returnToDock`, and `charging`.

2. **StateMachineStartsStates**
   - The state machine `roboticVacuumControl` has the start state: `idleMode`.

3. **StateMachineContainsTransitions**
   - The state machine `roboticVacuumControl` contains the transitions: `startCleaning`, `finishCleaning`, `lowBattery`, and `fullyCharged`.

4. **TransitionContainsEvents**
   - Transition `startCleaning` contains TimeEvent with time `5`.
   - Transition `finishCleaning` contains TimeEvent with time `120`.
   - Transition `lowBattery` contains TimeEvent with time `10`.
   - Transition `fullyCharged` contains TimeEvent with time `240`.

5. **StateTransition and TransitionState**

   - State `idleMode` has an outgoing transition `startCleaning` that leads to the state `cleanMode`.
   - State `cleanMode` has an outgoing transition `finishCleaning` that leads to the state `returnToDock`.
   - State `returnToDock` has an outgoing transition `lowBattery` that leads to the state `charging`.
   - State `charging` has an outgoing transition `fullyCharged` that leads back to the state `idleMode`.
   - Additionally, state `cleanMode` can transition directly to `returnToDock` if a `lowBattery` event occurs, which implies a conditional waiting while cleaning.

### Contextual Explanation

This instance represents operational scenarios of a robotic vacuum cleaner:

- The system starts in `idleMode` where the cleaner is waiting for user interaction or a scheduled task.
- Upon activation after a brief startup period (`startCleaning` transition), it enters `cleanMode` for 120 minutes.
- If the battery is low, it triggers `lowBattery` transition while cleaning, returning it to the dock for charging.
- Once docked it begins `charging`, and after receiving a `fullyCharged` signal, it transitions back to `idleMode`.
- This operational flow ensures that the robotic vacuum navigates through efficient cleaning and maintenance routines, showcasing both scheduled and adaptive behavior in response to battery level changes.

This instance adheres to all constraints while providing a distinct semantic perspective, distinct from a traffic light system, highlighting another practical application of state machines.

**TransitionContainsEvents**:
- Each transition, including `halt` with dual source states, is linked to one `TimeEvent`. 

**StateTransition**:
- Each state (`stationary`, `ascending`, `descending`, `maintenance`) has corresponding outflowing transitions, despite `halt` functioning as a dual-source transition.

**TransitionState**:
- Transitions properly result in specified destination states. Note the multi-source `halt` transition, exposing a realistic multi-origin scenario contrary to a single incoming rule.

### Constraint Violation Analysis

- **TimeIsPositive**: The transition `halt` features a `TimeEvent` with `time` set to `0`, which breaks the positive timing rule but represents situations like immediate stops triggered by emergency calls or safety features.

This example, contrasting previous scenarios, depicts a robust and operational framework for elevator control. It surfaces model limitations such as the necessity for zero-time responses during emergencies, highlighting overconstraints linked to time handling and acknowledging complex transition origins and targets.

Let's create an instance representing a Home Security Alarm System. This illustrates a system that handles various alerts and conditions within a residential security setup. The instance will include multiple states reflecting different security levels and responses to security breaches with a time-based alert system.

### Instance: Home Security Alarm System

#### Named Elements

1. **StateMachine**
   - Name: `homeSecurityAlarm`

2. **States**

   - State 1:
     - Name: `disarmed`
   
   - State 2:
     - Name: `armedStay`
   
   - State 3:
     - Name: `armedAway`
   
   - State 4:
     - Name: `alarmTriggered`

3. **Transitions**

   - Transition 1:
     - Name: `setToStay`
   
   - Transition 2:
     - Name: `setToAway`
   
   - Transition 3:
     - Name: `triggerAlarm`
   
   - Transition 4:
     - Name: `disarmAlarm`

4. **TimeEvents**

   - TimeEvent for Transition 1:
     - Time: `1`  (Grace period before arming in stay mode)
   
   - TimeEvent for Transition 2:
     - Time: `30` (Exit delay before arming away mode)
   
   - TimeEvent for Transition 3:
     - Time: `15` (Immediate trigger when breach detected)
   
   - TimeEvent for Transition 4:
     - Time: `3`  (Alarm reset once disarmed)

#### Relationships and Structure

1. **StateMachineContainsStates**
   - The state machine `homeSecurityAlarm` contains the states: `disarmed`, `armedStay`, `armedAway`, and `alarmTriggered`.

2. **StateMachineStartsStates**
   - The state machine `homeSecurityAlarm` has the start state: `disarmed`.

3. **StateMachineContainsTransitions**
   - The state machine `homeSecurityAlarm` contains the transitions: `setToStay`, `setToAway`, `triggerAlarm`, and `disarmAlarm`.

4. **TransitionContainsEvents**
   - Transition `setToStay` contains TimeEvent with time `1`.
   - Transition `setToAway` contains TimeEvent with time `30`.
   - Transition `triggerAlarm` contains TimeEvent with time `15`.
   - Transition `disarmAlarm` contains TimeEvent with time `3`.

5. **StateTransition and TransitionState**

   - State `disarmed` has outgoing transitions `setToStay` leading to `armedStay` and `setToAway` leading to `armedAway`.
   - State `armedStay` and `armedAway` both have an outgoing transition `triggerAlarm` leading to the state `alarmTriggered`.
   - State `alarmTriggered` has an outgoing transition `disarmAlarm` leading back to the state `disarmed`.

### Contextual Explanation

This scenario illustrates the operation of a home security alarm system:

- **Disarmed State**: The system is idle, not actively monitoring against breaches.
- **Armed Stay Mode**: Activates when the occupants are at home, minimizing interior motion sensor alerts but securing entry points. It takes a brief grace period of 1 second before activation.
- **Armed Away Mode**: Secures the home when no one is in, with a longer delay (30 seconds) allowing inhabitants to leave the house before activation.
- **Alarm Triggered**: If a security breach is detected while in either armed mode, the system immediately transitions to `alarmTriggered` after 15 seconds for reporting and logging purposes.
- **Disarmed Transition**: Once the authority or owner inputs the correct code, it takes 3 seconds for the system to transition back to `disarmed`.

This design allows the system to efficiently manage security conditions and operations, illustrating a different structural and semantic complexity compared to the previous instances, such as the traffic control or vacuum cleaner system. Here, emphasis is on security handling through state transitions based on timing and breach events.

   - **Associated Transition**: `rinseToSpin`

4. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 0 *(!!! Constraint Violation: TimeIsPositive !!!)*
   - **Associated Transition**: `endCycle`

### Relationships Analysis

**StateMachineContainsStates**:
- The `washingMachineCycle` encompasses a sequence of states: `idle`, `washing`, `rinsing`, `spinning`, and `off`, consistent with its operational loop requirements.

**StateMachineStartsStates**:
- The machine lacks an explicitly defined start state but utilizes the default `idle` status at initiation, aligning with optional start state guidelines.

**StateMachineContainsTransitions**:
- The transitions (`beginWash`, `washToRinse`, `rinseToSpin`, `endCycle`) are integrated, showcasing a full processing loop till shutdown or readiness.

**TransitionContainsEvents**:
- Each transition possesses a `TimeEvent`, although `endCycle` involves a zero-time event simulating an immediate shutdown or move to `idle` either post-spin or during an emergency stop.

**StateTransition**:
- Every state has logically arranged outgoing transitions. However, `endCycle` branches `spinning` to both `idle` and `off`, highlighting a constraint violation whereby one transition should lead to multiple target states.

**TransitionState**:
- The `endCycle` transition attempts transitioning a single source `spinning` to dual targets (`idle`, `off`), highlighting the need for more scalable modeling in reflecting real-world diversity in state transitions.

### Constraint Violation Analysis

- **TimeIsPositive**: The `endCycle` transition’s `TimeEvent` sets `time` to `0`, indicating immediate pausing or completion without delay. This acts as an overconstraint, suggesting model relaxation for immediate no-time processes such as urgent halts.
- **Multiple Targets**: The `endCycle` transition attempts to reach both `idle` and `off`, illustrating practical flexibility in finishing a cycle but defies strict structural requirements.

This scenario offers an illustration of a washing machine's cycle operation, employing multiple transition outcomes and instant no-delay operations, uncovering potential overconstraint challenges around modeling real-world dynamic transitions and process halts.

   - **Associated Transition**: `disarmToTrigger`

3. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 5
   - **Associated Transition**: `triggerToArm`

### Relationships Analysis

**StateMachineContainsStates**:
- The `homeSecuritySM` contains the states `armed`, `disarmed`, and `triggered`, fulfilling the composition requirement from `StateMachine` to `State`.

**StateMachineStartsStates**:
- The `homeSecuritySM` has no explicit start state defined, which is optional, aligning with the model.

**StateMachineContainsTransitions**:
- The `homeSecuritySM` operates the transitions `armToDisarm`, `disarmToTrigger`, and `triggerToArm`.

**TransitionContainsEvents**:
- Each transition (`armToDisarm`, `disarmToTrigger`, `triggerToArm`) has an associated `TimeEvent`, illustrating composition.

**StateTransition**:
- Each state (`armed`, `disarmed`, `triggered`) is correctly associated with its outgoing transitions.

**TransitionState**:
- Transitions connect appropriately to their target states, but note that the model's single incoming transition constraint is inherently brittle and may require relaxing in broader scenarios.

### Constraint Violation Analysis

- **TimeIsPositive**: The `disarmToTrigger` transition's `TimeEvent` with `time` set to `-15` violates the `TimeIsPositive` invariant. This exposes the rigidity of the model, necessitating consideration of scenario-based temporal flexibility (e.g., countdown before alarm trigger stop).

This example highlights a home security system, demonstrating valid operations yet showcasing problems in temporal flexibility and model restrictions such as negative timing for certain real-life scenarios like countdowns, hence detecting an overconstraint condition." }] }

### Contextual Explanation

This instance describes a smart irrigation system managing water distribution across an agricultural plot, considering maintenance schedules and weather conditions:

- **System Idle**: Initial state where the irrigation system awaits instructions. After a preliminary check-up, it starts irrigation.
- **Irrigating Mode**: Actively waters the field and can shift to maintenance or respond to weather changes.
- **Maintenance Mode**: Temporarily pauses watering for system checks or field inspection.
- **Weather Monitoring**: Responsive to external water input like rain, quickly pausing irrigation to conserve water based on sensor input. 
- **Cycle Completion**: Upon reaching this state after handling a rain event or after watering completes, it reverts to the idle state.

The design emphasizes shifts prompted by time-based events and environmental sensors, illustrating efficiency and adaptability in smart agriculture through state transitions distinctly different from previous instances like transportation or home security systems.

5. **StateTransition and TransitionState**

   - State `idleMode` has an outgoing transition `startCleaning` that leads to the state `cleanMode`.
   - State `cleanMode` has an outgoing transition `finishCleaning` that leads to the state `returnToDock`.
   - State `returnToDock` has an outgoing transition `lowBattery` that leads to the state `charging`.
   - State `charging` has an outgoing transition `fullyCharged` that leads back to the state `idleMode`.
   - Additionally, state `cleanMode` can transition directly to `returnToDock` if a `lowBattery` event occurs, which implies a conditional waiting while cleaning.

### Contextual Explanation

This instance represents operational scenarios of a robotic vacuum cleaner:

- The system starts in `idleMode` where the cleaner is waiting for user interaction or a scheduled task.
- Upon activation after a brief startup period (`startCleaning` transition), it enters `cleanMode` for 120 minutes.
- If the battery is low, it triggers `lowBattery` transition while cleaning, returning it to the dock for charging.
- Once docked it begins `charging`, and after receiving a `fullyCharged` signal, it transitions back to `idleMode`.
- This operational flow ensures that the robotic vacuum navigates through efficient cleaning and maintenance routines, showcasing both scheduled and adaptive behavior in response to battery level changes.

This instance adheres to all constraints while providing a distinct semantic perspective, distinct from a traffic light system, highlighting another practical application of state machines." }] }

   - **Name**: `greenLight`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `railroadSignalSystem`

2. **State**:
   - **Name**: `yellowLight`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `railroadSignalSystem`

3. **State**:
   - **Name**: `redLight`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `railroadSignalSystem`

#### Transitions

   - **Name**: `fromGreenToYellow`
   - **Source State**: `greenLight`
   - **Target State**: `yellowLight`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `railroadSignalSystem`

2. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `fromYellowToRed`
   - **Source State**: `yellowLight`
   - **Target State**: `redLight`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `railroadSignalSystem`

3. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `fromRedToGreen`
   - **Source State**: `redLight`
   - **Target State**: `greenLight`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `railroadSignalSystem`

4. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `emergencyStop`
   - **Source State**: `greenLight`, `yellowLight`
   - **Target State**: `redLight`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `railroadSignalSystem`

#### TimeEvents
1. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 60
   - **Associated Transition**: `fromGreenToYellow`

2. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 5
   - **Associated Transition**: `fromYellowToRed`

3. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: -1 *(!!! Constraint Violation: TimeIsPositive !!!)*
   - **Associated Transition**: `fromRedToGreen`

4. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 0 *(!!! Constraint Violation: TimeIsPositive !!!)*
   - **Associated Transition**: `emergencyStop`

### Relationships Analysis

**StateMachineContainsStates**:
- The `railroadSignalSystem` includes states `greenLight`, `yellowLight`, and `redLight`, in compliance with having multiple states in a circular sequence.

**StateMachineStartsStates**:
- A start state isn't explicitly designated; practically, signals begin at `redLight` for safety until activated, thus demonstrating optionality.

**StateMachineContainsTransitions**:
- Transitions listed include `fromGreenToYellow`, `fromYellowToRed`, `fromRedToGreen`, with `emergencyStop` serving as an auxiliary transition facilitating unplanned halts.

**TransitionContainsEvents**:
- Each transition pairs with a specific `TimeEvent`. For `emergencyStop`, the zero-time event symbolizes instantaneous state shifting, crucial for emergency responsiveness.

**StateTransition**:
- Associations are set up for each state to connect through designated transitions, particularly `greenLight` and `yellowLight` feeding into `redLight` through `emergencyStop`.

**TransitionState**:
- The usual cycle `green-yellow-red` is overridden by `emergencyStop` from either `greenLight` or `yellowLight`, highlighting practical dichotomies between predefined paths and dynamic emergency routes, defying a single incoming rule.

### Constraint Violation Analysis

- **TimeIsPositive**: The `fromRedToGreen` transition sets a negative time for signaling system testing or downtime, violating the positive constraint. Meanwhile, `emergencyStop` at zero highlights instantaneous reaction needs.
- **Multiple Source Transition**: `emergencyStop` skirting normal flow by having multifaceted source states (`greenLight`, `yellowLight`) tests the flexibility against single-source structuring.

This instance models the operation of a railroad signal system, critically addressing model overconstraints through instantaneous transitions for emergency protocols and negative time within testing contexts, pushing for adaptable state transition frameworks.

### Contextual Explanation

This instance represents a system designed to manage theatrical lighting transitions during a cinematic or dramatic performance. The system operates as follows:

- **Lights Off**: Initial state, prepares the venue in anticipation of the audience. 
- **Introduction Scene**: Begins with lights gradually turning on for an introductory mood, welcoming the audience.
- **Action Scene**: Transitions introduce high-energy, dynamic lighting sequences timed perfectly with the performance.
- **Romantic Scene**: Adjusts to softer, more intimate lighting.
- **Intermission**: Initiates a longer break period, gently winding down lighting before re-preparing the audience for more scenes.

Each transition is triggered by specific time events, adding richness to the theater experience by precisely orchestrating lighting effects, ensuring seamless transitions through lighting states corresponding to different dramatic scenarios. The design considers theatrical constraints and operational practices, notably different from previous system instances focusing on practical automation and security contexts.

   - **Associated StateMachines**: `trafficControlSM`

2. **State**:
   - **Name**: `amber`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `trafficControlSM`

3. **State**:
   - **Name**: `red`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `trafficControlSM`

4. **State**:
   - **Name**: `flashingAmber`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `trafficControlSM`

#### Transitions
1. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `greenToAmber`
   - **Source State**: `green`
   - **Target State**: `amber`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `trafficControlSM`

2. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `amberToRed`
   - **Source State**: `amber`
   - **Target State**: `red`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `trafficControlSM`

3. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `redToGreen`
   - **Source State**: `red`
   - **Target State**: `green`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `trafficControlSM`

5. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `emergency`
   - **Source States**: `green`, `amber`
   - **Target State**: `flashingAmber`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `trafficControlSM`

#### TimeEvents
1. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 30
   - **Associated Transition**: `greenToAmber`

2. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 5
   - **Associated Transition**: `amberToRed`

3. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 60
   - **Associated Transition**: `redToGreen`

4. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 0 *(!!! Constraint Violation: TimeIsPositive !!!)*
   - **Associated Transition**: `emergency`

### Relationships Analysis

**StateMachineContainsStates**:
- The `trafficControlSM` consists of states `green`, `amber`, `red`, and `flashingAmber`, catering to normal operations and special flashing protocols in emergencies.

**StateMachineStartsStates**:
- The `start state` isn't explicitly defined, but normal operations often begin at `red` for maximum initial safety, aligning with the optional start state nature.

**StateMachineContainsTransitions**:
- The transitions (`greenToAmber`, `amberToRed`, `redToGreen`, `emergency`) illustrate typical cycles, with `emergency` managing abrupt changes to a safety state.

**TransitionContainsEvents**:
- Every transition is associated with a `TimeEvent`, even `emergency`, which employs a zero-time event to reflect instantaneous change needed in urgent scenarios.

**StateTransition**:
- States transition logically following the cycle, with `green` and `amber` uniquely coping via `emergency` to `flashingAmber`, showing a real-world scenario of overriding the cycle.

**TransitionState**:
- The transitions are appropriately assigned to these states, however, `emergency` linking from both `green` and `amber` signifies variance from having a strict one-source allocation.

### Constraint Violation Analysis

- **TimeIsPositive**: The `emergency` transition’s `TimeEvent` utilizes zero-time to accommodate urgent traffic scenarios, challenging the positive-only limit.
- **Multiple Source Transition**: The link from both `green` and `amber` to `flashingAmber` demonstrates complex handcrafted logic depending on dual-entry restrictions.

This structure manages traffic light controls demonstrating overconstraints through critical assumptions about single-path and positive-time-only operations, promoting evolving methods for managing unexpected operational shifts and safety procedures at intersections.

   - State `alertCondition` transitions to `emergencyResponse` via `escalateEmergency`.
   - State `emergencyResponse` after being addressed can transition to `systemReset` via `resetSystem`.
   - State `maintenanceCheck` transitions back to `normalMonitoring` using `completeMaintenance`.

### Contextual Explanation

This instance is structured to manage a patient monitoring setup in a hospital, providing immediate alerts and switching operational modes to handle various conditions:

- **Normal Monitoring**: Monitors patients’ vital stats under normal conditions.
- **Alert Condition**: Engages upon detecting any deviations or abnormalities in patient data (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure), striving for immediate assessment within 1 second.
- **Emergency Response**: If the condition escalates, the system rapidly signals for medical intervention, switching states in 2 seconds.
- **Maintenance Check**: Periodically checks system integrity with 10-second intervals ensuring all components are functional.
- **System Reset**: Post-emergency resolution or maintenance, the system undergoes a quick reset to recalibrate and confirm system readiness.

Each transition is designed around time-critical healthcare responses, highlighting the system's purpose of ensuring patient safety and operational reliability. This framework is robust, semantically geared towards patient care as opposed to systems previously discussed, like entertainment or irrigation.

5. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 0 *(!!! Constraint Violation: TimeIsPositive !!!)*
   - **Associated Transition**: `deactivateAlarm`

### Relationships Analysis

**StateMachineContainsStates**:
- The `alarmClockSM` comprises multiple interactive states: `setTime`, `setAlarm`, `alarmActive`, `snooze`, and `off`, reflecting various alarm conditions.

**StateMachineStartsStates**:
- The starting state is not clearly mandated but functionally begins at `setTime`, a common initial step when configuring an alarm clock, satisfying flexibility around start state choice.

**StateMachineContainsTransitions**:
- The transitions (`timeToAlarm`, `activateAlarm`, `snoozeAlarm`, `alarmSnoozedToActive`, `deactivateAlarm`) follow a logical cycle of usage patterns typical for alarm operations.

**TransitionContainsEvents**:
- Each transition associates firmly with singular `TimeEvent`. Notably, `deactivateAlarm` calls a zero-time event for instant alarm cancellations, mimicking real-life user interactions.

**StateTransition**:
- Transition affinities are clearly in place across states, including dual-source to single-target configurations in `deactivateAlarm`, underscoring practical enactment complexities.

**TransitionState**:
- Although the core paths maintain coherence, `deactivateAlarm` underscores flexibility between states by transforming both `alarmActive` and `snooze` states to `off`, a breach in typical single-source structures.

### Constraint Violation Analysis

- **TimeIsPositive**: The `deactivateAlarm` spontaneity with a zero time for shutting off indicates critical precision and responsiveness needs, questioning the rigidity of positive-only times.
- **Multiple Source Transition**: `deactivateAlarm` addresses scenarios transitioning `alarmActive` and `snooze` together to `off`, illustrating nuanced navigation of model constraints against practical responsiveness.

This instance effectively captures an alarm clock's state management in household settings, highlighting critical overconstraint issues such as instantaneous deactivations and cross-source transitional pathways, encapsulating necessary adjustments for seamless user-centric operations.

### Relationships Analysis

**StateMachineContainsStates**:
- The `elevatorControlSM` includes `stationary`, `ascending`, `descending`, and `maintenance` states, fulfilling the requirement that it can have multiple states.

**StateMachineStartsStates**:
- The starting state of the `elevatorControlSM` is not explicitly defined, adhering to the optionality of the start state.

**StateMachineContainsTransitions**:
- The machine handles transitions `startAscend`, `startDescend`, `halt`, and `initiateMaintenance`. Notably, `halt` involves multiple sources (`ascending`, `descending`) leading to `stationary`, indicating an alternate transition design scenario in multi-source actions.

**TransitionContainsEvents**:
- Each transition, including `halt` with dual source states, is linked to one `TimeEvent`. 

**StateTransition**:
- Each state (`stationary`, `ascending`, `descending`, `maintenance`) has corresponding outflowing transitions, despite `halt` functioning as a dual-source transition.

**TransitionState**:
- Transitions properly result in specified destination states. Note the multi-source `halt` transition, exposing a realistic multi-origin scenario contrary to a single incoming rule.

### Constraint Violation Analysis

- **TimeIsPositive**: The transition `halt` features a `TimeEvent` with `time` set to `0`, which breaks the positive timing rule but represents situations like immediate stops triggered by emergency calls or safety features.

This example, contrasting previous scenarios, depicts a robust and operational framework for elevator control. It surfaces model limitations such as the necessity for zero-time responses during emergencies, highlighting overconstraints linked to time handling and acknowledging complex transition origins and targets." }] }

UserMessage { name = null contents = [TextContent { text = "Continue with the following description, creating the instance according to the syntax example and this specification: 
Let's create an instance representing a Home Security Alarm System. This illustrates a system that handles various alerts and conditions within a residential security setup. The instance will include multiple states reflecting different security levels and responses to security breaches with a time-based alert system.

### Instance: Home Security Alarm System

#### Named Elements

1. **StateMachine**
   - Name: `homeSecurityAlarm`

2. **States**

   - State 1:
     - Name: `disarmed`
   
   - State 2:
     - Name: `armedStay`
   
   - State 3:
     - Name: `armedAway`
   
   - State 4:
     - Name: `alarmTriggered`

3. **Transitions**

   - Transition 1:
     - Name: `setToStay`
   
   - Transition 2:
     - Name: `setToAway`
   
   - Transition 3:
     - Name: `triggerAlarm`
   
   - Transition 4:
     - Name: `disarmAlarm`

4. **TimeEvents**

   - TimeEvent for Transition 1:
     - Time: `1`  (Grace period before arming in stay mode)
   
   - TimeEvent for Transition 2:
     - Time: `30` (Exit delay before arming away mode)
   
   - TimeEvent for Transition 3:
     - Time: `15` (Immediate trigger when breach detected)
   
   - TimeEvent for Transition 4:
     - Time: `3`  (Alarm reset once disarmed)

#### Relationships and Structure

1. **StateMachineContainsStates**
   - The state machine `homeSecurityAlarm` contains the states: `disarmed`, `armedStay`, `armedAway`, and `alarmTriggered`.

2. **StateMachineStartsStates**
   - The state machine `homeSecurityAlarm` has the start state: `disarmed`.

3. **StateMachineContainsTransitions**
   - The state machine `homeSecurityAlarm` contains the transitions: `setToStay`, `setToAway`, `triggerAlarm`, and `disarmAlarm`.

4. **TransitionContainsEvents**
   - Transition `setToStay` contains TimeEvent with time `1`.
   - Transition `setToAway` contains TimeEvent with time `30`.
   - Transition `triggerAlarm` contains TimeEvent with time `15`.
   - Transition `disarmAlarm` contains TimeEvent with time `3`.

5. **StateTransition and TransitionState**

   - State `disarmed` has outgoing transitions `setToStay` leading to `armedStay` and `setToAway` leading to `armedAway`.
   - State `armedStay` and `armedAway` both have an outgoing transition `triggerAlarm` leading to the state `alarmTriggered`.
   - State `alarmTriggered` has an outgoing transition `disarmAlarm` leading back to the state `disarmed`.

### Contextual Explanation

This scenario illustrates the operation of a home security alarm system:

- **Disarmed State**: The system is idle, not actively monitoring against breaches.
- **Armed Stay Mode**: Activates when the occupants are at home, minimizing interior motion sensor alerts but securing entry points. It takes a brief grace period of 1 second before activation.
- **Armed Away Mode**: Secures the home when no one is in, with a longer delay (30 seconds) allowing inhabitants to leave the house before activation.
- **Alarm Triggered**: If a security breach is detected while in either armed mode, the system immediately transitions to `alarmTriggered` after 15 seconds for reporting and logging purposes.
- **Disarmed Transition**: Once the authority or owner inputs the correct code, it takes 3 seconds for the system to transition back to `disarmed`.

This design allows the system to efficiently manage security conditions and operations, illustrating a different structural and semantic complexity compared to the previous instances, such as the traffic control or vacuum cleaner system. Here, emphasis is on security handling through state transitions based on timing and breach events." }] }

   - Description: The state triggered by an incoming emergency alert, preparing resources for response.

3. **State:**
   - Name: `dispatching`
   - Description: In this state, emergency teams are deployed to the incident location.

4. **State:**
   - Name: `resolved`
   - Description: Final state indicating the incident has been handled and emergency resources are returning to standby.

5. **StateMachine:**
   - Name: `emergencyManager`
   - Description: A state machine managing the transition from alert receipt to situation resolution.

6. **Transition:**
   - Name: `readyToAlerted`
   - Description: Occurs when an emergency event is detected, moving from ready to alerted state.

7. **Transition:**
   - Name: `alertedToDispatching`
   - Description: Transitions from alerted to dispatching when the response team is ready for deployment.

## Instance: Washing Machine Cycle State Machine

### Entities

#### StateMachine
- **Name**: `washingMachineCycle`
- **Description**: This state machine governs the cyclical states of a household washing machine.

#### States
1. **State**:
   - **Name**: `idle`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `washingMachineCycle`

2. **State**:
   - **Name**: `washing`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `washingMachineCycle`

3. **State**:
   - **Name**: `rinsing`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `washingMachineCycle`

4. **State**:
   - **Name**: `spinning`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `washingMachineCycle`

5. **State**:
   - **Name**: `off`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `washingMachineCycle`

#### Transitions
1. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `beginWash`
   - **Source State**: `idle`
   - **Target State**: `washing`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `washingMachineCycle`

2. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `washToRinse`
   - **Source State**: `washing`
   - **Target State**: `rinsing`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `washingMachineCycle`

3. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `rinseToSpin`
   - **Source State**: `rinsing`
   - **Target State**: `spinning`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `washingMachineCycle`

4. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `endCycle`
   - **Source State**: `spinning`
   - **Target States**: `idle` *(!!! Constraint Violation !!!), `off`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `washingMachineCycle`

#### TimeEvents
1. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 5
   - **Associated Transition**: `beginWash`

2. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 8
   - **Associated Transition**: `washToRinse`

3. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 10
   - **Associated Transition**: `rinseToSpin`

4. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 0 *(!!! Constraint Violation: TimeIsPositive !!!)*
   - **Associated Transition**: `endCycle`

### Relationships Analysis

**StateMachineContainsStates**:
- The `washingMachineCycle` encompasses a sequence of states: `idle`, `washing`, `rinsing`, `spinning`, and `off`, consistent with its operational loop requirements.

**StateMachineStartsStates**:
- The machine lacks an explicitly defined start state but utilizes the default `idle` status at initiation, aligning with optional start state guidelines.

**StateMachineContainsTransitions**:
- The transitions (`beginWash`, `washToRinse`, `rinseToSpin`, `endCycle`) are integrated, showcasing a full processing loop till shutdown or readiness.

**TransitionContainsEvents**:
- Each transition possesses a `TimeEvent`, although `endCycle` involves a zero-time event simulating an immediate shutdown or move to `idle` either post-spin or during an emergency stop.

**StateTransition**:
- Every state has logically arranged outgoing transitions. However, `endCycle` branches `spinning` to both `idle` and `off`, highlighting a constraint violation whereby one transition should lead to multiple target states.

**TransitionState**:
- The `endCycle` transition attempts transitioning a single source `spinning` to dual targets (`idle`, `off`), highlighting the need for more scalable modeling in reflecting real-world diversity in state transitions.

### Constraint Violation Analysis

- **TimeIsPositive**: The `endCycle` transition’s `TimeEvent` sets `time` to `0`, indicating immediate pausing or completion without delay. This acts as an overconstraint, suggesting model relaxation for immediate no-time processes such as urgent halts.
- **Multiple Targets**: The `endCycle` transition attempts to reach both `idle` and `off`, illustrating practical flexibility in finishing a cycle but defies strict structural requirements.

This scenario offers an illustration of a washing machine's cycle operation, employing multiple transition outcomes and instant no-delay operations, uncovering potential overconstraint challenges around modeling real-world dynamic transitions and process halts." }] }

   - TimeEvent for Transition 2:
     - Time: `5`   (Pause for maintenance check)
   
   - TimeEvent for Transition 3:
     - Time: `15`  (Resume irrigation after maintenance)
   
   - TimeEvent for Transition 4:
     - Time: `2`   (Quick change in response to rain sensor)
   
   - TimeEvent for Transition 5:
     - Time: `30`  (Complete cycle and revert to idle)

#### Relationships and Structure

1. **StateMachineContainsStates**
   - The state machine `smartIrrigationControl` contains the states: `systemIdle`, `irrigating`, `maintenanceMode`, and `weatherMonitoring`.

2. **StateMachineStartsStates**
   - The state machine `smartIrrigationControl` has the start state: `systemIdle`.

3. **StateMachineContainsTransitions**
   - The state machine `smartIrrigationControl` contains the transitions: `startIrrigation`, `pauseForMaintenance`, `resumeIrrigation`, `handleRainEvent`, and `completeCycle`.

4. **TransitionContainsEvents**
   - Transition `startIrrigation` contains TimeEvent with time `10`.
   - Transition `pauseForMaintenance` contains TimeEvent with time `5`.
   - Transition `resumeIrrigation` contains TimeEvent with time `15`.
   - Transition `handleRainEvent` contains TimeEvent with time `2`.
   - Transition `completeCycle` contains TimeEvent with time `30`.

5. **StateTransition and TransitionState**

   - State `systemIdle` has an outgoing transition `startIrrigation` leading to the state `irrigating`.
   - State `irrigating` has two outgoing transitions: `pauseForMaintenance` leading to `maintenanceMode` and `handleRainEvent` leading to `weatherMonitoring`.
   - State `maintenanceMode` has an outgoing transition `resumeIrrigation` leading back to `irrigating`.
   - State `weatherMonitoring` has an outgoing transition `completeCycle` leading back to `systemIdle`.

### Contextual Explanation

This instance describes a smart irrigation system managing water distribution across an agricultural plot, considering maintenance schedules and weather conditions:

- **System Idle**: Initial state where the irrigation system awaits instructions. After a preliminary check-up, it starts irrigation.
- **Irrigating Mode**: Actively waters the field and can shift to maintenance or respond to weather changes.
- **Maintenance Mode**: Temporarily pauses watering for system checks or field inspection.
- **Weather Monitoring**: Responsive to external water input like rain, quickly pausing irrigation to conserve water based on sensor input. 
- **Cycle Completion**: Upon reaching this state after handling a rain event or after watering completes, it reverts to the idle state.

The design emphasizes shifts prompted by time-based events and environmental sensors, illustrating efficiency and adaptability in smart agriculture through state transitions distinctly different from previous instances like transportation or home security systems." }] }

## Instance: Railroad Signal Control State Machine

### Entities

#### StateMachine
- **Name**: `railroadSignalSystem`
- **Description**: Controls the signaling states on a railway track to manage train traffic safely and efficiently.

#### States
1. **State**:
   - **Name**: `greenLight`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `railroadSignalSystem`

2. **State**:
   - **Name**: `yellowLight`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `railroadSignalSystem`

3. **State**:
   - **Name**: `redLight`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `railroadSignalSystem`

#### Transitions
1. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `fromGreenToYellow`
   - **Source State**: `greenLight`
   - **Target State**: `yellowLight`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `railroadSignalSystem`

2. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `fromYellowToRed`
   - **Source State**: `yellowLight`
   - **Target State**: `redLight`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `railroadSignalSystem`

3. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `fromRedToGreen`
   - **Source State**: `redLight`
   - **Target State**: `greenLight`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `railroadSignalSystem`

4. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `emergencyStop`
   - **Source State**: `greenLight`, `yellowLight`
   - **Target State**: `redLight`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `railroadSignalSystem`

#### TimeEvents
1. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 60
   - **Associated Transition**: `fromGreenToYellow`

2. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 5
   - **Associated Transition**: `fromYellowToRed`

3. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: -1 *(!!! Constraint Violation: TimeIsPositive !!!)*
   - **Associated Transition**: `fromRedToGreen`

4. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 0 *(!!! Constraint Violation: TimeIsPositive !!!)*
   - **Associated Transition**: `emergencyStop`

### Relationships Analysis

**StateMachineContainsStates**:
- The `railroadSignalSystem` includes states `greenLight`, `yellowLight`, and `redLight`, in compliance with having multiple states in a circular sequence.

**StateMachineStartsStates**:
- A start state isn't explicitly designated; practically, signals begin at `redLight` for safety until activated, thus demonstrating optionality.

**StateMachineContainsTransitions**:
- Transitions listed include `fromGreenToYellow`, `fromYellowToRed`, `fromRedToGreen`, with `emergencyStop` serving as an auxiliary transition facilitating unplanned halts.

**TransitionContainsEvents**:
- Each transition pairs with a specific `TimeEvent`. For `emergencyStop`, the zero-time event symbolizes instantaneous state shifting, crucial for emergency responsiveness.

**StateTransition**:
- Associations are set up for each state to connect through designated transitions, particularly `greenLight` and `yellowLight` feeding into `redLight` through `emergencyStop`.

**TransitionState**:
- The usual cycle `green-yellow-red` is overridden by `emergencyStop` from either `greenLight` or `yellowLight`, highlighting practical dichotomies between predefined paths and dynamic emergency routes, defying a single incoming rule.

### Constraint Violation Analysis

- **TimeIsPositive**: The `fromRedToGreen` transition sets a negative time for signaling system testing or downtime, violating the positive constraint. Meanwhile, `emergencyStop` at zero highlights instantaneous reaction needs.
- **Multiple Source Transition**: `emergencyStop` skirting normal flow by having multifaceted source states (`greenLight`, `yellowLight`) tests the flexibility against single-source structuring.

This instance models the operation of a railroad signal system, critically addressing model overconstraints through instantaneous transitions for emergency protocols and negative time within testing contexts, pushing for adaptable state transition frameworks." }] }

   - State `introductionScene` has an outgoing transition `switchToAction` leading to the state `actionScene`.
   - State `actionScene` can transition to `romanticScene` using the `switchToRomantic` and to `intermission` using `startIntermission`.
   - State `romanticScene` can also transition to `intermission`.
   - State `intermission` has an outgoing transition `resumeFromIntermission` leading back to `introductionScene` to restart the sequence.

### Contextual Explanation

This instance represents a system designed to manage theatrical lighting transitions during a cinematic or dramatic performance. The system operates as follows:

- **Lights Off**: Initial state, prepares the venue in anticipation of the audience. 
- **Introduction Scene**: Begins with lights gradually turning on for an introductory mood, welcoming the audience.
- **Action Scene**: Transitions introduce high-energy, dynamic lighting sequences timed perfectly with the performance.
- **Romantic Scene**: Adjusts to softer, more intimate lighting.
- **Intermission**: Initiates a longer break period, gently winding down lighting before re-preparing the audience for more scenes.

Each transition is triggered by specific time events, adding richness to the theater experience by precisely orchestrating lighting effects, ensuring seamless transitions through lighting states corresponding to different dramatic scenarios. The design considers theatrical constraints and operational practices, notably different from previous system instances focusing on practical automation and security contexts." }] }

## Instance: Traffic Light Control State Machine

### Entities

#### StateMachine
- **Name**: `trafficControlSM`
- **Description**: Governs the state transitions of a traffic light system at a busy intersection.

#### States
1. **State**:
   - **Name**: `green`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `trafficControlSM`

2. **State**:
   - **Name**: `amber`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `trafficControlSM`

3. **State**:
   - **Name**: `red`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `trafficControlSM`

4. **State**:
   - **Name**: `flashingAmber`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `trafficControlSM`

#### Transitions
1. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `greenToAmber`
   - **Source State**: `green`
   - **Target State**: `amber`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `trafficControlSM`

2. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `amberToRed`
   - **Source State**: `amber`
   - **Target State**: `red`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `trafficControlSM`

3. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `redToGreen`
   - **Source State**: `red`
   - **Target State**: `green`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `trafficControlSM`

5. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `emergency`
   - **Source States**: `green`, `amber`
   - **Target State**: `flashingAmber`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `trafficControlSM`

#### TimeEvents
1. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 30
   - **Associated Transition**: `greenToAmber`

2. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 5
   - **Associated Transition**: `amberToRed`

3. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 60
   - **Associated Transition**: `redToGreen`

4. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 0 *(!!! Constraint Violation: TimeIsPositive !!!)*
   - **Associated Transition**: `emergency`

### Relationships Analysis

**StateMachineContainsStates**:
- The `trafficControlSM` consists of states `green`, `amber`, `red`, and `flashingAmber`, catering to normal operations and special flashing protocols in emergencies.

**StateMachineStartsStates**:
- The `start state` isn't explicitly defined, but normal operations often begin at `red` for maximum initial safety, aligning with the optional start state nature.

**StateMachineContainsTransitions**:
- The transitions (`greenToAmber`, `amberToRed`, `redToGreen`, `emergency`) illustrate typical cycles, with `emergency` managing abrupt changes to a safety state.

**TransitionContainsEvents**:
- Every transition is associated with a `TimeEvent`, even `emergency`, which employs a zero-time event to reflect instantaneous change needed in urgent scenarios.

**StateTransition**:
- States transition logically following the cycle, with `green` and `amber` uniquely coping via `emergency` to `flashingAmber`, showing a real-world scenario of overriding the cycle.

**TransitionState**:
- The transitions are appropriately assigned to these states, however, `emergency` linking from both `green` and `amber` signifies variance from having a strict one-source allocation.

### Constraint Violation Analysis

- **TimeIsPositive**: The `emergency` transition’s `TimeEvent` utilizes zero-time to accommodate urgent traffic scenarios, challenging the positive-only limit.
- **Multiple Source Transition**: The link from both `green` and `amber` to `flashingAmber` demonstrates complex handcrafted logic depending on dual-entry restrictions.

This structure manages traffic light controls demonstrating overconstraints through critical assumptions about single-path and positive-time-only operations, promoting evolving methods for managing unexpected operational shifts and safety procedures at intersections." }] }

   - State `normalMonitoring` has outgoing transitions `detectAlert` leading to `alertCondition` and `performMaintenance` leading to `maintenanceCheck`.
   - State `alertCondition` transitions to `emergencyResponse` via `escalateEmergency`.
   - State `emergencyResponse` after being addressed can transition to `systemReset` via `resetSystem`.
   - State `maintenanceCheck` transitions back to `normalMonitoring` using `completeMaintenance`.

### Contextual Explanation

This instance is structured to manage a patient monitoring setup in a hospital, providing immediate alerts and switching operational modes to handle various conditions:

- **Normal Monitoring**: Monitors patients’ vital stats under normal conditions.
- **Alert Condition**: Engages upon detecting any deviations or abnormalities in patient data (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure), striving for immediate assessment within 1 second.
- **Emergency Response**: If the condition escalates, the system rapidly signals for medical intervention, switching states in 2 seconds.
- **Maintenance Check**: Periodically checks system integrity with 10-second intervals ensuring all components are functional.
- **System Reset**: Post-emergency resolution or maintenance, the system undergoes a quick reset to recalibrate and confirm system readiness.

Each transition is designed around time-critical healthcare responses, highlighting the system's purpose of ensuring patient safety and operational reliability. This framework is robust, semantically geared towards patient care as opposed to systems previously discussed, like entertainment or irrigation." }] }

   - **Name**: `setTime`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `alarmClockSM`

2. **State**:
   - **Name**: `setAlarm`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `alarmClockSM`

3. **State**:
   - **Name**: `alarmActive`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `alarmClockSM`

   - **Associated StateMachines**: `alarmClockSM`

2. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `activateAlarm`
   - **Source State**: `setAlarm`
   - **Target State**: `alarmActive`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `alarmClockSM`

3. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `snoozeAlarm`
   - **Source State**: `alarmActive`
   - **Target State**: `snooze`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `alarmClockSM`

4. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `alarmSnoozedToActive`
   - **Source State**: `snooze`
   - **Target State**: `alarmActive`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `alarmClockSM`

5. **Transition**:
   - **Name**: `deactivateAlarm`
   - **Source States**: `alarmActive`, `snooze`
   - **Target State**: `off`
   - **Associated StateMachines**: `alarmClockSM`

#### TimeEvents
1. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 15
   - **Associated Transition**: `timeToAlarm`

2. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 10
   - **Associated Transition**: `activateAlarm`

3. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 5
   - **Associated Transition**: `snoozeAlarm`

4. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 300
   - **Associated Transition**: `alarmSnoozedToActive`

5. **TimeEvent**:
   - **Time**: 0 *(!!! Constraint Violation: TimeIsPositive !!!)*
   - **Associated Transition**: `deactivateAlarm`

### Relationships Analysis

**StateMachineContainsStates**:
- The `alarmClockSM` comprises multiple interactive states: `setTime`, `setAlarm`, `alarmActive`, `snooze`, and `off`, reflecting various alarm conditions.

**StateMachineStartsStates**:
- The starting state is not clearly mandated but functionally begins at `setTime`, a common initial step when configuring an alarm clock, satisfying flexibility around start state choice.

**StateMachineContainsTransitions**:
- The transitions (`timeToAlarm`, `activateAlarm`, `snoozeAlarm`, `alarmSnoozedToActive`, `deactivateAlarm`) follow a logical cycle of usage patterns typical for alarm operations.

**TransitionContainsEvents**:
- Each transition associates firmly with singular `TimeEvent`. Notably, `deactivateAlarm` calls a zero-time event for instant alarm cancellations, mimicking real-life user interactions.

**StateTransition**:
- Transition affinities are clearly in place across states, including dual-source to single-target configurations in `deactivateAlarm`, underscoring practical enactment complexities.

**TransitionState**:
- Although the core paths maintain coherence, `deactivateAlarm` underscores flexibility between states by transforming both `alarmActive` and `snooze` states to `off`, a breach in typical single-source structures.

### Constraint Violation Analysis

- **TimeIsPositive**: The `deactivateAlarm` spontaneity with a zero time for shutting off indicates critical precision and responsiveness needs, questioning the rigidity of positive-only times.
- **Multiple Source Transition**: `deactivateAlarm` addresses scenarios transitioning `alarmActive` and `snooze` together to `off`, illustrating nuanced navigation of model constraints against practical responsiveness.

This instance effectively captures an alarm clock's state management in household settings, highlighting critical overconstraint issues such as instantaneous deactivations and cross-source transitional pathways, encapsulating necessary adjustments for seamless user-centric operations." }] }

### Relationships:

- **StateMachineContainsStates**:
  - The state machine `wildlifeTrackingProtocol` comprises states `initializeSensors`, `collectData`, `analyzePatterns`, `detectThreats`, `initiateProtection`, `reportFindings`, and `resetSystem`.

- **StateMachineStartsStates**:
  - The state machine `wildlifeTrackingProtocol` commences with the `initializeSensors` state.

- **StateMachineContainsTransitions**:
  - The state machine `wildlifeTrackingProtocol` contains transitions `activateTracking`, `performAnalysis`, `evaluateThreats`, `raiseAlert`, `compileData`, `confirmSafety`, `cycleReset`, and `startOver`.

- **TransitionContainsEvents**:
  - Transition `activateTracking` is associated with the event `setupTime`.
  - Transition `performAnalysis` includes the event `dataCollectionDuration`.
  - Transition `evaluateThreats` involves `analysisDuration`.
  - Transition `raiseAlert` connects to `threatResponseTime`.
  - Transition `compileData` uses `reportingTime`.
  - Transition `cycleReset` involves `resetDuration`.

- **StateTransition**:
  - The `initializeSensors` state transitions to `collectData` via `activateTracking`.
  - The `collectData` state moves to `analyzePatterns` through `performAnalysis`.
  - The `analyzePatterns` state transitions either to `detectThreats` via `evaluateThreats` or directly to `reportFindings` via `compileData`.
  - The `detectThreats` state proceeds to `initiateProtection` through `raiseAlert`.
  - From `initiateProtection`, the state transitions to `reportFindings` via `confirmSafety`.
  - The `reportFindings` state proceeds to `resetSystem` through `cycleReset`.
  - The `resetSystem` state transitions back to `initializeSensors` using `startOver`.
