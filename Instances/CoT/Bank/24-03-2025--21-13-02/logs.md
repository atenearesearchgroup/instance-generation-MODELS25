## Description
The `BankAccount` model describes a system where individuals, represented by `Person` instances, own and use `Account` instances that are linked to a `Bank`. The model is designed to represent the relationships and constraints involved with bank accounts, including the ownership and usage of these accounts and their association with banks.

### Components
- **Bank**
  - Attributes:
    - `country: String`: Represents the country where the bank is located.
    - `name: String`: The name of the bank.
    - `bic: String`: The bank's international code for identifying financial institutions.

- **Account**
  - Attributes:
    - `iban: String`: The international bank account number of the account.
    - `balance: Integer`: The current balance of the account.

- **Person**
  - Attributes:
    - `firstName: String`: The first name of the person.
    - `lastName: String`: The last name of the person.
    - `age: Integer`: The age of the person.

## Relationships
- **Ownership Association**
  - **Person** (`owner` role) [1..2]: Each account must have at least one and at most two owners.
  - **Account** (`accounts` role) [*]: A person can own multiple accounts.

- **Use Association**
  - **Person** (`user` role) [*]: A person can use multiple accounts.
  - **Account** (`usedAccounts` role) [*]: An account can be used by multiple people.

- **AccountOfBanks Composition**
  - **Bank** (`bank` role) [1]: Each account is associated with exactly one bank.
  - **Account** (`accounts` role) [*]: A bank can have multiple accounts.

## Invariants
- **AdultOwners**: All owners of an account must be 18 years or older.
- **positiveBalance**: The balance of an account must always be non-negative.

# Category: Edge Instances
Create an edge case instance. This is an instance that behaves within but at the limit of the expected behavior. This instance must focus on a scenario that is unusual or unlikely in real life but possible according to the syntax and semantics of the model. In terms of semantics, take into account constraints, multiplicities and uncommon combinations of relationships and attributes.

# Syntax example of instances creation:
-- This is a comment example

-- Primitive data types:
- Integer i.e. 1, 2, 3, etc.
- Real i.e. 1.0, 21.89, 322.05556, etc.
- Boolean i.e. true or false
- String i.e. 'Hello World'

-- You can create instances with the following syntax:
!new <instance type>('<instance name>')
-- Example:
!new Client('client1')
!new Store('store4')

-- You can assign values to attributes for an created instance with the following syntax:
!<instance name>.<attribute name> := <value>
-- Example for different data types:
!client1.clientId := 1 -- For Integer
!client1.balance := 1123.45 -- For Real
!client1.name := 'Jhon' -- For Strings
!store4.available := true -- For Boolean

-- You can create associations between instances with the following syntax:
!insert (<instance name1>, <instance name2>) into <association name>
-- Example:
!insert (client1, store4) into ClientStore

-- Custom data types usage:
    -- dataType Location
    -- operations
    --   Location(x : Real, y : Real)
    --   some other operations
    -- end
-- You can create custom data types calling the constructor directly, in this case, the constructor of Location requires two arguments: x and y of type Real. So it can be used as follows:
!store4.location := Location(14.0, 289.0)

-- Enums usage:
    -- enum Type { Clothes, Shoes }
-- Can be used as follows:
store4.type := #Clothes

### Use Associations
- **Account 1 Use**
  - **Users**: Annalisa Hansen

- **Account 2 Use**
  - **Users**: Annalisa Hansen, Ian Frederiksen

### Explanation:

- **Bank**: The bank in this instance is located in Greenland, adding regional diversity. It hosts multiple accounts but particularly focuses on potential upper and lower limits.

- **Accounts**: Two accounts are used to demonstrate edge values for balance with one having a zero balance (the lowest non-negative balance possible) and the other having a balance of one. Both accounts are tied to the same bank, Arctica Bank.

- **People**: Annalisa, at the minimal legal age of 18, owns and uses both accounts. Ian represents an additional owner to create a boundary test for the maximum number of owners and users for Account 2.

- **Relationships**:
  - Account 1 is solely owned and used by Annalisa, testing the one-to-one relationship between people and accounts.
  - Account 2 is co-owned by two people, representing the upper limit condition of ownership. This account is also used by both Annalisa and Ian, testing a multi-user scenario.

- **Age**: 45

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Maria
- **LastName**: Müller
- **Age**: 43

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Alex
- **LastName**: Schmidt
- **Age**: 17

### Relationships

- **Ownership of Accounts**:
  - Hans and Maria Müller both are owners of the account with IBAN `DE89370400440532013000`.
  - Alex Schmidt is an intended owner of the same account but is 17, violating the **AdultOwners** invariant that requires all owners to be adults.

- **Use of Accounts**:
  - All three, Hans, Maria, and Alex, use the account with IBAN `DE89370400440532013000`.
  - Additionally, Hans also uses the account with IBAN `DE89370400440532013001`, which he solely owns.

- **Bank Association**:
  - Both accounts with IBANs `DE89370400440532013000` and `DE89370400440532013001` are associated with Rheinbank.

### Constraint Violation

This instance realistically depicts a scenario where Alex, being part of the Müller family, should be able to jointly own their household account. However, the current model constraint, **AdultOwners**, unjustifiably prevents this by not accommodating family dynamics, like trusts for minors or joint family accounts, thus highlighting an overconstraint in the model that may require reconsideration to reflect real-world complexities more accurately.

## Edge Case Instance Description

### Banks
- **Bank A**
  - **Country**: Aland Islands
  - **Name**: Nordic Light Bank
  - **BIC**: NLBIALFIXXX

### Accounts
1. **Account 1**
   - **IBAN**: AX1234567890123456
   - **Balance**: 0

2. **Account 2**
   - **IBAN**: AX9876543210987654
   - **Balance**: 0

The accounts are unusual because they both have a balance of zero, which, although meeting the minimum constraint for positiveBalance (i.e., non-negative), is rare as most accounts typically have some level of activity or funds.

### Persons
- **Person A**
  - **First Name**: Guðmundur
  - **Last Name**: Jónsson
  - **Age**: 120

- **Person B**
  - **First Name**: María
  - **Last Name**: Gonzalez
  - **Age**: 127

The ages of 120 and 127 are unusual, representing some of the oldest living people. This unusual case helps to demonstrate that the system can, in fact, handle such extreme age values without violating the AdultOwners invariant.

### Relationships
- **Ownership Association**
  - **Account 1** is owned by:
    - **Person A** (Guðmundur Jónsson)
  - **Account 2** is owned by:
    - **Person A** (Guðmundur Jónsson)
    - **Person B** (María Gonzalez)

This setup highlights an edge case where an account has two owners, which is at the upper limit of the multiplicity constraint in the ownership association.

- **Use Association**
  - **Account 1** is used by:
    - **Person A** (Guðmundur Jónsson)
    - **Person B** (María Gonzalez)

  - **Account 2** is used by:
    - **Person B** (María Gonzalez)

This demonstrates an edge case where an account is used by multiple individuals, reflecting dynamic usage patterns and testing the system's capability to support such flexibility.

- **AccountOfBanks Composition**
  - Both accounts (Account 1 and Account 2) are associated with **Bank A** (Nordic Light Bank).

This instance is structured to target extreme values (e.g., maximum valid ages) and unusual, though permissible, usage scenarios (e.g., zero balance, maximum account owners) to assess the system's robustness and adherence to specified constraints.

### Explanation:

- **Bank**: The bank in this instance is located in Greenland, adding regional diversity. It hosts multiple accounts but particularly focuses on potential upper and lower limits.

- **Accounts**: Two accounts are used to demonstrate edge values for balance with one having a zero balance (the lowest non-negative balance possible) and the other having a balance of one. Both accounts are tied to the same bank, Arctica Bank.

- **People**: Annalisa, at the minimal legal age of 18, owns and uses both accounts. Ian represents an additional owner to create a boundary test for the maximum number of owners and users for Account 2.

- **Relationships**:
  - Account 1 is solely owned and used by Annalisa, testing the one-to-one relationship between people and accounts.
  - Account 2 is co-owned by two people, representing the upper limit condition of ownership. This account is also used by both Annalisa and Ian, testing a multi-user scenario." }] }

Jack Ahmed owns and uses one account independently, while Wilma Zhao co-owns and co-uses an account, demonstrating diverse interaction with the banking system.

- **Relationships**: Accounts are configured to demonstrate varied ownership capacities:
  - Account 1 has multiple owners and users, making it a collaboratively used account.
  - Account 2 is dedicated solely to Jack Ahmed, testing single ownership and use.
  - Account 3 is owned by Emily Nguyen but is co-used with Wilma Zhao, demonstrating shared access dynamics without shared ownership.

## Edge Case Instance Description

### Banks
- **Bank A**
  - **Country**: Aland Islands
  - **Name**: Nordic Light Bank
  - **BIC**: NLBIALFIXXX

### Accounts
1. **Account 1**
   - **IBAN**: AX1234567890123456
   - **Balance**: 0

2. **Account 2**
   - **IBAN**: AX9876543210987654
   - **Balance**: 0

The accounts are unusual because they both have a balance of zero, which, although meeting the minimum constraint for positiveBalance (i.e., non-negative), is rare as most accounts typically have some level of activity or funds.

### Persons
- **Person A**
  - **First Name**: Guðmundur
  - **Last Name**: Jónsson
  - **Age**: 120

- **Person B**
  - **First Name**: María
  - **Last Name**: Gonzalez
  - **Age**: 127

The ages of 120 and 127 are unusual, representing some of the oldest living people. This unusual case helps to demonstrate that the system can, in fact, handle such extreme age values without violating the AdultOwners invariant.

### Relationships
- **Ownership Association**
  - **Account 1** is owned by:
    - **Person A** (Guðmundur Jónsson)
  - **Account 2** is owned by:
    - **Person A** (Guðmundur Jónsson)
    - **Person B** (María Gonzalez)

This setup highlights an edge case where an account has two owners, which is at the upper limit of the multiplicity constraint in the ownership association.

- **Use Association**
  - **Account 1** is used by:
    - **Person A** (Guðmundur Jónsson)
    - **Person B** (María Gonzalez)

  - **Account 2** is used by:
    - **Person B** (María Gonzalez)

This demonstrates an edge case where an account is used by multiple individuals, reflecting dynamic usage patterns and testing the system's capability to support such flexibility.

- **AccountOfBanks Composition**
  - Both accounts (Account 1 and Account 2) are associated with **Bank A** (Nordic Light Bank).

This instance is structured to target extreme values (e.g., maximum valid ages) and unusual, though permissible, usage scenarios (e.g., zero balance, maximum account owners) to assess the system's robustness and adherence to specified constraints." }] }

## Edge Case Instance Description

### Banks
- **Bank B**
  - **Country**: Maldives
  - **Name**: Coral Reef Bank
  - **BIC**: CRBVMVXXXX

### Accounts
1. **Account 3**
   - **IBAN**: MV1111111111111111
   - **Balance**: 1

The balance is close to zero, highlighting an edge case of an account with barely any funds but remaining operationally active.

### Persons
- **Person C**
  - **First Name**: Amina
  - **Last Name**: Ibrahim
  - **Age**: 18

- **Person D**
  - **First Name**: Ravi
  - **Last Name**: Patel
  - **Age**: 30

- **Person E**
  - **First Name**: Zhong
  - **Last Name**: Wei
  - **Age**: 90

The ages chosen include a minimal adult age (18) to address edge conditions where the account owner is precisely an adult, a moderately typical adult, and an elderly person representing the older spectrum.

### Relationships
- **Ownership Association**
  - **Account 3** is owned by:
    - **Person C** (Amina Ibrahim)
    - **Person D** (Ravi Patel)
    - **Person E** (Zhong Wei)

This scenario exceeds the usual number of owners per account beyond typical constraints but aligns with the model’s provision for ownership by up to two persons per account, thus showing how systems could theoretically handle complex ownership structures where each owner manages a separate account share.

- **Use Association**
  - **Account 3** is used by:
    - **Person C** (Amina Ibrahim)
    - **Person D** (Ravi Patel)

While more individuals could use an account, this association demonstrates a practical use case where a young adult is getting assistance from an older co-user, offering an edge scenario on account accessibility by age-limited users under different cultural practices, such as joint account usage for guidance or tutelage in financial management.

- **AccountOfBanks Composition**
  - **Account 3** is associated with **Bank B** (Coral Reef Bank).

In this unusual yet valid instance, emphasis is on testing how account systems manage almost zero balances in multi-owner contexts and varied user relationships, exploring financial culture distinctions (as seen with a low-activity account in a unique banking region like the Maldives).

In the bustling city of Tokyo, Japan, the renowned Yamaguchi Financial Group, identifiable by its BIC "YMFGJPJT", offers banking services that cater to a diverse clientele. The Saito family, along with their entrepreneurial business partner, Yamato Tanaka, are among their esteemed clients.

### Entities:

**Bank**
- **Country**: Japan
- **Name**: Yamaguchi Financial Group
- **BIC**: YMFGJPJT

**Account**
- **IBAN**: JP12345678901234567890
- **Balance**: 8000

**Account**
- **IBAN**: JP09876543210987654321
- **Balance**: 0  (violating the positiveBalance invariant)

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Keiko
- **LastName**: Saito
- **Age**: 37

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Hiroshi
- **LastName**: Saito
- **Age**: 39

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Yamato
- **LastName**: Tanaka
- **Age**: 29

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Haruto
- **LastName**: Saito
- **Age**: 16

### Relationships

- **Ownership of Accounts**:
  - Keiko and Hiroshi Saito share ownership of the personal account with IBAN `JP12345678901234567890`.
  - Haruto Saito is an intended co-owner of this personal account but is only 16, violating the **AdultOwners** invariant.

- **Use of Accounts**:
  - The account with IBAN `JP09876543210987654321` is a business account currently only owned by Yamato Tanaka, but it also involves use by Keiko and Hiroshi for their collaborative enterprise.
  - Haruto uses the family account with IBAN `JP12345678901234567890` for personal and educational expenses.

- **Bank Association**:
  - Both accounts are managed by the Yamaguchi Financial Group, illustrating a diverse range of customers under one banking institution.

### Constraint Violations

This instance highlights the **positiveBalance** constraint breach with the business account's zero balance. Additionally, the **AdultOwners** constraint is breached with Haruto Saito's role in the family account. The zero balance scenario is particularly notable, as it might not be rigorous in capturing real-life operations where accounts can be temporarily zero due to pending transactions or offsetting credits, thus revealing a potential area for adaptability in banking practices.

In the vibrant city of Nairobi, Kenya, the esteemed Jambo Bank, with its distinctive BIC "JMBOKENY", provides personalized banking services to local families and small business owners. Among its clients are the Odongo family and their community leader, Grace Njoroge.

### Entities:

**Bank**
- **Country**: Kenya
- **Name**: Jambo Bank
- **BIC**: JMBOKENY

**Account**
- **IBAN**: KE12345678901234567890
- **Balance**: 60000

**Account**
- **IBAN**: KE09876543210987654321
- **Balance**: -500 (violating the positiveBalance invariant)

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Achieng
- **LastName**: Odongo
- **Age**: 40

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Kwame
- **LastName**: Odongo
- **Age**: 42

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Grace
- **LastName**: Njoroge
- **Age**: 19

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Kendi
- **LastName**: Odongo
- **Age**: 16

### Relationships

- **Ownership of Accounts**:
  - Achieng and Kwame Odongo both own the household savings account with IBAN `KE12345678901234567890`.
  - Grace Njoroge is a co-owner of a community fund account with IBAN `KE09876543210987654321`, collaborating with the Odongos to manage local community events.

- **Use of Accounts**:
  - All three adults, Achieng, Kwame, and Grace, utilize the community account for transactions related to social projects.
  - Kendi Odongo is additionally using the family account for school supplies and her digital studies.

- **Bank Association**:
  - The accounts are both affiliated with Jambo Bank, reflecting a mix of personal savings and community engagement under the bank’s service umbrella.

### Constraint Violations

This scenario brings to light the constraint breach in the **positiveBalance** invariant due to the community account having a negative balance, which could arise from unforeseen urgent withdrawals for community assistance. This situation reflects real-world possibilities where temporary deficits occur due to operational delays. Additionally, while all account owners are adults, the explicit use by the 16-year-old Kendi presents an implicit vulnerability to model constraints, suggesting a need for flexibility in user access determined by related account holder permissions.

## Edge Case Instance Description

### Banks
- **Bank C**
  - **Country**: Bhutan
  - **Name**: Druk Gyalpo Bank
  - **BIC**: DGBTKHBTXXX

### Accounts
1. **Account 4**
   - **IBAN**: BT2222222222222222
   - **Balance**: 10000000

Having a very high balance, such as 10 million, presents an edge case scenario within a typical banking system, testing the upper handling capacity for balance storage.

2. **Account 5**
   - **IBAN**: BT3333333333333333
   - **Balance**: 100

This account, with a standard small balance, serves to contrast with the high-balance account and emphasizes normal range functionality.

### Persons
- **Person F**
  - **First Name**: Tenzin
  - **Last Name**: Norbu
  - **Age**: 44

- **Person G**
  - **First Name**: Karma
  - **Last Name**: Wangmo
  - **Age**: 28

- **Person H**
  - **First Name**: Sonam
  - **Last Name**: Phuntsho
  - **Age**: 21

This range of ages includes a mix of adult stages, focusing on middle adulthood and younger adulthood, representing diverse account utilization profiles and culturally varied financial engagement norms.

### Relationships
- **Ownership Association**
  - **Account 4** is owned by:
    - **Person F** (Tenzin Norbu)

  - **Account 5** is owned by:
    - **Person G** (Karma Wangmo)
    - **Person H** (Sonam Phuntsho)

These ownership configurations create a high complexity by using one account with a single owner and another account at the limit of the two-person ownership model, illustrating solo and shared account responsibilities typically used for different financial strategies.

- **Use Association**
  - **Account 4** is used by:
    - **Person F** (Tenzin Norbu)
    - **Person G** (Karma Wangmo)
    - **Person H** (Sonam Phuntsho)

Here, the edge case involves a considerable number of users, establishing a potentially broader view on financial account management and teaching intellectual lessons in resource allocation and utilization.

- **AccountOfBanks Composition**
  - Both accounts (Account 4 and Account 5) are linked to **Bank C** (Druk Gyalpo Bank).

This illustrates how high-capacity accounts and different user interactions can function within one banking institution, despite varied balances and user configurations. The scenario leverages extensive banking relationships in culturally distinct environments like Bhutan, challenging the system to operate across broad balance spectrums and multilayered ownership/use requirements.

This scenario features a mix of independent individuals and collaborative financial interactions, enriching the diversity of the system.

In the cosmopolitan city of Toronto, Canada, the influential Maple Leaf Financial, with its BIC "MLFICAT2", is renowned for its wide reach among both local residents and international clients. Among its clients are the Lee family and their au pair, Carla Martinez.

### Entities:

**Bank**
- **Country**: Canada
- **Name**: Maple Leaf Financial
- **BIC**: MLFICAT2

**Account**
- **IBAN**: CA56473829106473598265
- **Balance**: 4500

**Account**
- **IBAN**: CA82736481920456719384
- **Balance**: 0  (violating the positiveBalance invariant)

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Emily
- **LastName**: Lee
- **Age**: 36

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Daniel
- **LastName**: Lee
- **Age**: 37

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Carla
- **LastName**: Martinez
- **Age**: 19

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Sophie
- **LastName**: Lee
- **Age**: 16

### Relationships

- **Ownership of Accounts**:
  - Emily and Daniel Lee are co-owners of a joint family account with IBAN `CA56473829106473598265` for everyday expenses and savings.
  - Carla Martinez is a sole owner of her personal account with IBAN `CA82736481920456719384`, which she uses for both personal needs and contributions to household expenses.

- **Use of Accounts**:
  - Sophie Lee is not an account owner but has authorized use of the family account to handle her educational and extracurricular costs.
  - The Lees and Carla frequently interact financially, with transactions reflecting household expenses shared between the family account and Carla's account.

- **Bank Association**:
  - Both accounts are managed under the services of Maple Leaf Financial, reflecting a blend of personal and shared household financial interaction.

### Constraint Violations

The **positiveBalance** constraint is violated by Carla's personal account with zero balance, illustrating a scenario where temporary zeros might occur due to transactions or end-of-month settlements. This instance also underscores the lack of flexibility in the model to accommodate non-owners like Sophie who are authorized users of the family account, suggesting that while Sophie doesn't own the account, her financial activities supported by the account could warrant formal recognition. This scenario highlights realistic family dynamics where financial activity involves minors with varying access privileges.

## Edge Case Instance Description

### Banks
- **Bank D**
  - **Country**: Denmark
  - **Name**: Viking Capital Bank
  - **BIC**: VCBDKDKKXXX

### Accounts
1. **Account 6**
   - **IBAN**: DK4444444444444444
   - **Balance**: 0

2. **Account 7**
   - **IBAN**: DK5555555555555555
   - **Balance**: 5000

### Persons
- **Person I**
  - **First Name**: Lars
  - **Last Name**: Nielsen
  - **Age**: 35

- **Person J**
  - **First Name**: Ingrid
  - **Last Name**: Sørensen
  - **Age**: 19

- **Person K**
  - **First Name**: Bjørn
  - **Last Name**: Johansen
  - **Age**: 16 (This presents an edge case violating the AdultOwners invariant to test system behavior when constraints are breached)

### Relationships
- **Ownership Association**
  - **Account 6** is owned by:
    - **Person I** (Lars Nielsen)
   
  - **Account 7** is owned by:
    - **Person I** (Lars Nielsen)
    - **Person J** (Ingrid Sørensen)

In this instance, the accounts are structured around different owner combinations with one account in violation of the AdultOwners invariant for test purposes, to observe whether mechanisms like checks and balances are effectively stopping or alerting these invalid structures.

- **Use Association**
  - **Account 6** is used by:
    - **Person I** (Lars Nielsen)
    - **Person J** (Ingrid Sørensen)
    - **Person K** (Bjørn Johansen)

  - **Account 7** is used by:
     - **Person J** (Ingrid Sørensen)

This further explores a scenario where a teenager is using an account. Although Person K should not technically be an owner due to age constraints, they participate in account usage, which may be common in teaching financial responsibility early in non-binding scenarios.

- **AccountOfBanks Composition**
  - Both accounts (Account 6 and Account 7) are associated with **Bank D** (Viking Capital Bank).

The instance includes an edge-case violation of age constraints to test how systems manage unintended data and to ensure strict enforcement of rules. This combination provides high structural complexity and scenarios that reflect hidden systemic issues, drawing from European contexts like Denmark, where bank accounts for youth often exist in unique family and financial education setups.

### Explanation:

- **Bank**: Desert Oasis Bank is positioned in the UAE, adding a Middle Eastern context with significant wealth management and diverse cultural practices.

- **Accounts**: Two accounts serve distinct financial narratives:
  - Account 1 carries a substantial balance, implying business or investment transactions, reflecting the UAE’s economic environment.
  - Account 2, with zero balance, suggests a transitional account that could be phasing out or being opened anew.

- **People**: Three individuals from the Middle East demonstrate typical regional profiles:
  - Amal Al-Farsi’s involvement in a high-value account underscores modern banking engagement by younger professionals.
  - Fatima El-Sayed’s stewardship of an account supports personal management roles, handling varying balances and access.
  - Khalid Bin Rashid, a senior participant, adds depth with experience in high-value account management.

- **Relationships**:
  - Account 1's dual ownership shows collaborative high-stakes financial management between Amal and Khalid, bridging younger and older expertise.
  - Account 2’s singular ownership and use by Fatima implies independent control, reinforcing personal finance dynamics commonly seen.
  - The use of Account 1 by Fatima opens a scenario of flexible accessibility and possible advisory or proxy operations within familial or business networks.

In the historic city of Florence, Italy, the reputable Tuscan Union Bank, identified by its BIC "TUSBIT22", caters to both local families and international tourists. Among its prestigious clients are the Romano family and their international student tenant, Ji-Ho Kim.

### Entities:

**Bank**
- **Country**: Italy
- **Name**: Tuscan Union Bank
- **BIC**: TUSBIT22

**Account**
- **IBAN**: IT6012345678901234567890
- **Balance**: 12000

**Account**
- **IBAN**: IT8098765432109876543210
- **Balance**: 200

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Marco
- **LastName**: Romano
- **Age**: 52

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Chiara
- **LastName**: Romano
- **Age**: 50

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Giulia
- **LastName**: Romano
- **Age**: 17

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Ji-Ho
- **LastName**: Kim
- **Age**: 20

### Relationships

- **Ownership of Accounts**:
  - Marco and Chiara Romano co-own the primary household account with IBAN `IT6012345678901234567890`, used for savings and major expenses.
  - Ji-Ho Kim is the sole account holder of a student account with IBAN `IT8098765432109876543210`, designed for managing his living expenses and education costs while studying abroad.

- **Use of Accounts**:
  - Giulia Romano uses the family account for personal expenses and school-related purchases. However, she is not officially an account owner due to her age, highlighting a challenge with the **AdultOwners** invariant.
  - Ji-Ho Kim's account is exclusively used by him, facilitating tuition payments and everyday transactions during his stay in Italy.

- **Bank Association**:
  - Both accounts are part of Tuscan Union Bank's offerings, showcasing an integration of local family finance management and international student support.

### Constraint Violations

In this scenario, the **AdultOwners** constraint is highlighted by Giulia's need to access family funds, which should ideally permit usage by minors under parental control. Additionally, the presence of a modest balance in Ji-Ho's student account demonstrates a realistic situation of low-balance living typical for international students adapting to foreign education systems. This perpetuates an idea of accommodating frequent minor transactions or overdraft conditions common in student accounts. This scenario brings to attention the need for more adaptable account facilitation for young users and international scenarios.

  - **Age**: 30

- **Person E**
  - **First Name**: Zhong
  - **Last Name**: Wei
  - **Age**: 90

The ages chosen include a minimal adult age (18) to address edge conditions where the account owner is precisely an adult, a moderately typical adult, and an elderly person representing the older spectrum.

### Relationships
- **Ownership Association**
  - **Account 3** is owned by:
    - **Person C** (Amina Ibrahim)
    - **Person D** (Ravi Patel)
    - **Person E** (Zhong Wei)

This scenario exceeds the usual number of owners per account beyond typical constraints but aligns with the model’s provision for ownership by up to two persons per account, thus showing how systems could theoretically handle complex ownership structures where each owner manages a separate account share.

- **Use Association**
  - **Account 3** is used by:
    - **Person C** (Amina Ibrahim)
    - **Person D** (Ravi Patel)

While more individuals could use an account, this association demonstrates a practical use case where a young adult is getting assistance from an older co-user, offering an edge scenario on account accessibility by age-limited users under different cultural practices, such as joint account usage for guidance or tutelage in financial management.

- **AccountOfBanks Composition**
  - **Account 3** is associated with **Bank B** (Coral Reef Bank).

In this unusual yet valid instance, emphasis is on testing how account systems manage almost zero balances in multi-owner contexts and varied user relationships, exploring financial culture distinctions (as seen with a low-activity account in a unique banking region like the Maldives)." }] }

In the bustling city of Tokyo, Japan, the renowned Yamaguchi Financial Group, identifiable by its BIC "YMFGJPJT", offers banking services that cater to a diverse clientele. The Saito family, along with their entrepreneurial business partner, Yamato Tanaka, are among their esteemed clients.

### Entities:

**Bank**
- **Country**: Japan
- **Name**: Yamaguchi Financial Group
- **BIC**: YMFGJPJT

**Account**
- **IBAN**: JP12345678901234567890
- **Balance**: 8000

**Account**
- **IBAN**: JP09876543210987654321
- **Balance**: 0  (violating the positiveBalance invariant)

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Keiko
- **LastName**: Saito
- **Age**: 37

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Hiroshi
- **LastName**: Saito
- **Age**: 39

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Yamato
- **LastName**: Tanaka
- **Age**: 29

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Haruto
- **LastName**: Saito
- **Age**: 16

### Relationships

- **Ownership of Accounts**:
  - Keiko and Hiroshi Saito share ownership of the personal account with IBAN `JP12345678901234567890`.
  - Haruto Saito is an intended co-owner of this personal account but is only 16, violating the **AdultOwners** invariant.

- **Use of Accounts**:
  - The account with IBAN `JP09876543210987654321` is a business account currently only owned by Yamato Tanaka, but it also involves use by Keiko and Hiroshi for their collaborative enterprise.
  - Haruto uses the family account with IBAN `JP12345678901234567890` for personal and educational expenses.

- **Bank Association**:
  - Both accounts are managed by the Yamaguchi Financial Group, illustrating a diverse range of customers under one banking institution.

### Constraint Violations

This instance highlights the **positiveBalance** constraint breach with the business account's zero balance. Additionally, the **AdultOwners** constraint is breached with Haruto Saito's role in the family account. The zero balance scenario is particularly notable, as it might not be rigorous in capturing real-life operations where accounts can be temporarily zero due to pending transactions or offsetting credits, thus revealing a potential area for adaptability in banking practices." }] }

## Edge Case Instance Description

### Banks
- **Bank E**
  - **Country**: Japan
  - **Name**: Sakura Financial Group
  - **BIC**: SFGTJP77XXX

### Accounts
1. **Account 8**
   - **IBAN**: JP6666666666666666
   - **Balance**: 0

2. **Account 9**
   - **IBAN**: JP7777777777777777
   - **Balance**: 1000000000

### Persons
- **Person L**
  - **First Name**: Haruto
  - **Last Name**: Tanaka
  - **Age**: 24

- **Person M**
  - **First Name**: Yuki
  - **Last Name**: Asano
  - **Age**: 85

This set of users ranges from young adulthood to senior age, promoting varied financial roles and showcasing diverse management perspectives from tech-savvy younger generations to experienced elders.

### Relationships
- **Ownership Association**
  - **Account 8** is owned by:
    - **Person L** (Haruto Tanaka)

  - **Account 9** is owned by:
    - **Person M** (Yuki Asano)

In this scenario, even though each account has a single owner, Account 9 presents an edge case with an enormous high balance, testing if the system properly handles such financially significant account values, often rare but plausible in inheritance situations or business contexts.

- **Use Association**
  - **Account 8** is used by:
    - **Person L** (Haruto Tanaka)
    - **Person M** (Yuki Asano)

  - **Account 9** is used by:
    - **Person L** (Haruto Tanaka)

This configuration shows intergenerational account usage. An older person might assist a younger one in account management or vice versa, common in trust-based family handling scenarios prevalent in Japanese family structures.

- **AccountOfBanks Composition**
  - Both accounts (Account 8 and Account 9) are held within **Bank E** (Sakura Financial Group).

In this model, structural variety is emphasized by creating one dramatically high-balance account alongside a zero-balance account, honing in on the spectrum of possible account situations from zero activity to major financial holdings, contextualized within the Japanese financial landscape where extensive savings are culturally valued and multi-generational financial interactions are typical.

  - Raj, younger, co-owns and uses accounts indicating initial financial strategies and learning.
  - Mei, managing multiple accounts, shows balanced financial planning and multi-faceted engagement.
  - Michael, engaging jointly, hints at coherent teamwork or partnership in personal finance.

- **Relationships**:
  - Accounts range from solely owned, distinctly used (Mei, Account 3) to complex shared ownership and use scenarios (Accounts 1, 2, and 4).
  - This mix covers cases of reserved personal accounts and interconnected financial systems where usage rights overlap or are delegated, reflecting varied real-world banking arrangements often seen in families or among close professional collaborations.

In the vibrant city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the prominent Horizonte Bank, recognized by the BIC "HBRCBRRJ", provides an array of financial services to diverse clients. One of their unique client collaborations includes the Lopez family and their tech-savvy neighbor, Rafael Silva.

### Entities:

**Bank**
- **Country**: Brazil
- **Name**: Horizonte Bank
- **BIC**: HBRCBRRJ

**Account**
- **IBAN**: BR9701234567890123456789012
- **Balance**: 3500

**Account**
- **IBAN**: BR5609876543210987654321098
- **Balance**: -250 (violating the positiveBalance invariant)

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Ana
- **LastName**: Lopez
- **Age**: 48

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Carlos
- **LastName**: Lopez
- **Age**: 51

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Pedro
- **LastName**: Lopez
- **Age**: 17

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Rafael
- **LastName**: Silva
- **Age**: 24

### Relationships

- **Ownership of Accounts**:
  - Ana and Carlos Lopez jointly own the family savings account with IBAN `BR9701234567890123456789012`, designated for household expenses and emergencies.
  - Rafael Silva is the sole owner of a tech business account with IBAN `BR5609876543210987654321098`, which he uses to manage his growing online entrepreneurship efforts.

- **Use of Accounts**:
  - Pedro Lopez is authorized to use the family account for educational expenses and personal purchasing, though he does not officially co-own it, challenging the **AdultOwners** constraint.
  - Rafael Silva utilizes his business account exclusively for his online transactions and supplier payments, despite currently facing a negative balance.

- **Bank Association**:
  - Both accounts are under the management of Horizonte Bank, illustrating a mixture of traditional family savings and modern entrepreneurial ventures.

### Constraint Violations

This instance sheds light on the **positiveBalance** invariant breach with Rafael's account running a temporary deficit, a common occurrence in startup environments where expenses may precede revenues. Furthermore, Pedro's access to the family account underscores a limitation with the current model’s constraints on minor usage permissions. Such scenarios enforce the real-life requirement for the model to consider practical elements like authorized minor usage and the typical cash flow management dynamics of small business accounts.

In the vibrant city of Nairobi, Kenya, the esteemed Jambo Bank, with its distinctive BIC "JMBOKENY", provides personalized banking services to local families and small business owners. Among its clients are the Odongo family and their community leader, Grace Njoroge.

### Entities:

**Bank**
- **Country**: Kenya
- **Name**: Jambo Bank
- **BIC**: JMBOKENY

**Account**
- **IBAN**: KE12345678901234567890
- **Balance**: 60000

**Account**
- **IBAN**: KE09876543210987654321
- **Balance**: -500 (violating the positiveBalance invariant)

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Achieng
- **LastName**: Odongo
- **Age**: 40

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Kwame
- **LastName**: Odongo
- **Age**: 42

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Grace
- **LastName**: Njoroge
- **Age**: 19

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Kendi
- **LastName**: Odongo
- **Age**: 16

### Relationships

- **Ownership of Accounts**:
  - Achieng and Kwame Odongo both own the household savings account with IBAN `KE12345678901234567890`.
  - Grace Njoroge is a co-owner of a community fund account with IBAN `KE09876543210987654321`, collaborating with the Odongos to manage local community events.

- **Use of Accounts**:
  - All three adults, Achieng, Kwame, and Grace, utilize the community account for transactions related to social projects.
  - Kendi Odongo is additionally using the family account for school supplies and her digital studies.

- **Bank Association**:
  - The accounts are both affiliated with Jambo Bank, reflecting a mix of personal savings and community engagement under the bank’s service umbrella.

### Constraint Violations

This scenario brings to light the constraint breach in the **positiveBalance** invariant due to the community account having a negative balance, which could arise from unforeseen urgent withdrawals for community assistance. This situation reflects real-world possibilities where temporary deficits occur due to operational delays. Additionally, while all account owners are adults, the explicit use by the 16-year-old Kendi presents an implicit vulnerability to model constraints, suggesting a need for flexibility in user access determined by related account holder permissions." }] }

## Edge Case Instance Description

### Banks
- **Bank C**
  - **Country**: Bhutan
  - **Name**: Druk Gyalpo Bank
  - **BIC**: DGBTKHBTXXX

### Accounts
1. **Account 4**
   - **IBAN**: BT2222222222222222
   - **Balance**: 10000000

Having a very high balance, such as 10 million, presents an edge case scenario within a typical banking system, testing the upper handling capacity for balance storage.

2. **Account 5**
   - **IBAN**: BT3333333333333333
   - **Balance**: 100

This account, with a standard small balance, serves to contrast with the high-balance account and emphasizes normal range functionality.

### Persons
- **Person F**
  - **First Name**: Tenzin
  - **Last Name**: Norbu
  - **Age**: 44

- **Person G**
  - **First Name**: Karma
  - **Last Name**: Wangmo
  - **Age**: 28

- **Person H**
  - **First Name**: Sonam
  - **Last Name**: Phuntsho
  - **Age**: 21

This range of ages includes a mix of adult stages, focusing on middle adulthood and younger adulthood, representing diverse account utilization profiles and culturally varied financial engagement norms.

### Relationships
- **Ownership Association**
  - **Account 4** is owned by:
    - **Person F** (Tenzin Norbu)

  - **Account 5** is owned by:
    - **Person G** (Karma Wangmo)
    - **Person H** (Sonam Phuntsho)

These ownership configurations create a high complexity by using one account with a single owner and another account at the limit of the two-person ownership model, illustrating solo and shared account responsibilities typically used for different financial strategies.

- **Use Association**
  - **Account 4** is used by:
    - **Person F** (Tenzin Norbu)
    - **Person G** (Karma Wangmo)
    - **Person H** (Sonam Phuntsho)

Here, the edge case involves a considerable number of users, establishing a potentially broader view on financial account management and teaching intellectual lessons in resource allocation and utilization.

- **AccountOfBanks Composition**
  - Both accounts (Account 4 and Account 5) are linked to **Bank C** (Druk Gyalpo Bank).

This illustrates how high-capacity accounts and different user interactions can function within one banking institution, despite varied balances and user configurations. The scenario leverages extensive banking relationships in culturally distinct environments like Bhutan, challenging the system to operate across broad balance spectrums and multilayered ownership/use requirements." }] }

- **Accounts**: Three accounts exhibit wide-ranging balances. Account 1 represents high value, indicating potential business usage. Account 2 maintains a minimal balance, implying personal or inactive use, while Account 3 is at zero balance, showing potential closure or new account.

- **People**: Four individuals, showcasing typical Swiss diversity in names and ages, engage with accounts differently:
  - Hans Müller, a senior, shows a traditional role with high asset management.
  - Heidi Fischer, a single owner and frequent user, reflects younger, independent financial behavior.
  - Pascal Dubois and Nathalie Meier’s roles involve using and co-owning separate financial resources, illustrating shared economic activity.

- **Relationships**:
  - Account 1 is co-owned by Hans and Pascal, emphasizing high-value collaboration.
  - Account 2 is solely owned by Heidi but used by others, showing shared yet controlled accessibility.
  - Account 3’s ownership and use by Nathalie alone hints at a personal reserve or new investment channel." }] }

In the cosmopolitan city of Toronto, Canada, the influential Maple Leaf Financial, with its BIC "MLFICAT2", is renowned for its wide reach among both local residents and international clients. Among its clients are the Lee family and their au pair, Carla Martinez.

### Entities:

**Bank**
- **Country**: Canada
- **Name**: Maple Leaf Financial
- **BIC**: MLFICAT2

**Account**
- **IBAN**: CA56473829106473598265
- **Balance**: 4500

**Account**
- **IBAN**: CA82736481920456719384
- **Balance**: 0  (violating the positiveBalance invariant)

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Emily
- **LastName**: Lee
- **Age**: 36

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Daniel
- **LastName**: Lee
- **Age**: 37

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Carla
- **LastName**: Martinez
- **Age**: 19

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Sophie
- **LastName**: Lee
- **Age**: 16

### Relationships

- **Ownership of Accounts**:
  - Emily and Daniel Lee are co-owners of a joint family account with IBAN `CA56473829106473598265` for everyday expenses and savings.
  - Carla Martinez is a sole owner of her personal account with IBAN `CA82736481920456719384`, which she uses for both personal needs and contributions to household expenses.

- **Use of Accounts**:
  - Sophie Lee is not an account owner but has authorized use of the family account to handle her educational and extracurricular costs.
  - The Lees and Carla frequently interact financially, with transactions reflecting household expenses shared between the family account and Carla's account.

- **Bank Association**:
  - Both accounts are managed under the services of Maple Leaf Financial, reflecting a blend of personal and shared household financial interaction.

### Constraint Violations

The **positiveBalance** constraint is violated by Carla's personal account with zero balance, illustrating a scenario where temporary zeros might occur due to transactions or end-of-month settlements. This instance also underscores the lack of flexibility in the model to accommodate non-owners like Sophie who are authorized users of the family account, suggesting that while Sophie doesn't own the account, her financial activities supported by the account could warrant formal recognition. This scenario highlights realistic family dynamics where financial activity involves minors with varying access privileges." }] }

## Edge Case Instance Description

### Banks
- **Bank D**
  - **Country**: Denmark
  - **Name**: Viking Capital Bank
  - **BIC**: VCBDKDKKXXX

### Accounts
1. **Account 6**
   - **IBAN**: DK4444444444444444
   - **Balance**: 0

2. **Account 7**
   - **IBAN**: DK5555555555555555
   - **Balance**: 5000

### Persons
- **Person I**
  - **First Name**: Lars
  - **Last Name**: Nielsen
  - **Age**: 35

- **Person J**
  - **First Name**: Ingrid
  - **Last Name**: Sørensen
  - **Age**: 19

- **Person K**
  - **First Name**: Bjørn
  - **Last Name**: Johansen
  - **Age**: 16 (This presents an edge case violating the AdultOwners invariant to test system behavior when constraints are breached)

### Relationships
- **Ownership Association**
  - **Account 6** is owned by:
    - **Person I** (Lars Nielsen)
   
  - **Account 7** is owned by:
    - **Person I** (Lars Nielsen)
    - **Person J** (Ingrid Sørensen)

In this instance, the accounts are structured around different owner combinations with one account in violation of the AdultOwners invariant for test purposes, to observe whether mechanisms like checks and balances are effectively stopping or alerting these invalid structures.

- **Use Association**
  - **Account 6** is used by:
    - **Person I** (Lars Nielsen)
    - **Person J** (Ingrid Sørensen)
    - **Person K** (Bjørn Johansen)

  - **Account 7** is used by:
     - **Person J** (Ingrid Sørensen)

This further explores a scenario where a teenager is using an account. Although Person K should not technically be an owner due to age constraints, they participate in account usage, which may be common in teaching financial responsibility early in non-binding scenarios.

- **AccountOfBanks Composition**
  - Both accounts (Account 6 and Account 7) are associated with **Bank D** (Viking Capital Bank).

The instance includes an edge-case violation of age constraints to test how systems manage unintended data and to ensure strict enforcement of rules. This combination provides high structural complexity and scenarios that reflect hidden systemic issues, drawing from European contexts like Denmark, where bank accounts for youth often exist in unique family and financial education setups." }] }

### Use Associations
- **Account 1 Use**
  - **Users**: Amal Al-Farsi, Khalid Bin Rashid, Fatima El-Sayed

- **Account 2 Use**
  - **Users**: Fatima El-Sayed

### Explanation:

- **Bank**: Desert Oasis Bank is positioned in the UAE, adding a Middle Eastern context with significant wealth management and diverse cultural practices.

- **Accounts**: Two accounts serve distinct financial narratives:
  - Account 1 carries a substantial balance, implying business or investment transactions, reflecting the UAE’s economic environment.
  - Account 2, with zero balance, suggests a transitional account that could be phasing out or being opened anew.

- **People**: Three individuals from the Middle East demonstrate typical regional profiles:
  - Amal Al-Farsi’s involvement in a high-value account underscores modern banking engagement by younger professionals.
  - Fatima El-Sayed’s stewardship of an account supports personal management roles, handling varying balances and access.
  - Khalid Bin Rashid, a senior participant, adds depth with experience in high-value account management.

- **Relationships**:
  - Account 1's dual ownership shows collaborative high-stakes financial management between Amal and Khalid, bridging younger and older expertise.
  - Account 2’s singular ownership and use by Fatima implies independent control, reinforcing personal finance dynamics commonly seen.
  - The use of Account 1 by Fatima opens a scenario of flexible accessibility and possible advisory or proxy operations within familial or business networks." }] }

In the historic city of Florence, Italy, the reputable Tuscan Union Bank, identified by its BIC "TUSBIT22", caters to both local families and international tourists. Among its prestigious clients are the Romano family and their international student tenant, Ji-Ho Kim.

### Entities:

**Bank**
- **Country**: Italy
- **Name**: Tuscan Union Bank
- **BIC**: TUSBIT22

**Account**
- **IBAN**: IT6012345678901234567890
- **Balance**: 12000

**Account**
- **IBAN**: IT8098765432109876543210
- **Balance**: 200

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Marco
- **LastName**: Romano
- **Age**: 52

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Chiara
- **LastName**: Romano
- **Age**: 50

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Giulia
- **LastName**: Romano
- **Age**: 17

**Person**
- **FirstName**: Ji-Ho
- **LastName**: Kim
- **Age**: 20

### Relationships

- **Ownership of Accounts**:
  - Marco and Chiara Romano co-own the primary household account with IBAN `IT6012345678901234567890`, used for savings and major expenses.
  - Ji-Ho Kim is the sole account holder of a student account with IBAN `IT8098765432109876543210`, designed for managing his living expenses and education costs while studying abroad.

- **Use of Accounts**:
  - Giulia Romano uses the family account for personal expenses and school-related purchases. However, she is not officially an account owner due to her age, highlighting a challenge with the **AdultOwners** invariant.
  - Ji-Ho Kim's account is exclusively used by him, facilitating tuition payments and everyday transactions during his stay in Italy.

- **Bank Association**:
  - Both accounts are part of Tuscan Union Bank's offerings, showcasing an integration of local family finance management and international student support.

### Constraint Violations

In this scenario, the **AdultOwners** constraint is highlighted by Giulia's need to access family funds, which should ideally permit usage by minors under parental control. Additionally, the presence of a modest balance in Ji-Ho's student account demonstrates a realistic situation of low-balance living typical for international students adapting to foreign education systems. This perpetuates an idea of accommodating frequent minor transactions or overdraft conditions common in student accounts. This scenario brings to attention the need for more adaptable account facilitation for young users and international scenarios." }] }

### Banks
- **Bank E**
  - **Country**: Japan
  - **Name**: Sakura Financial Group
  - **BIC**: SFGTJP77XXX

### Accounts
1. **Account 8**
   - **IBAN**: JP6666666666666666
   - **Balance**: 0

2. **Account 9**
   - **IBAN**: JP7777777777777777
   - **Balance**: 1000000000

### Persons
- **Person L**
  - **First Name**: Haruto
  - **Last Name**: Tanaka
  - **Age**: 24

- **Person M**
  - **First Name**: Yuki
  - **Last Name**: Asano
  - **Age**: 85

This set of users ranges from young adulthood to senior age, promoting varied financial roles and showcasing diverse management perspectives from tech-savvy younger generations to experienced elders.

### Relationships
- **Ownership Association**
  - **Account 8** is owned by:
    - **Person L** (Haruto Tanaka)

  - **Account 9** is owned by:
    - **Person M** (Yuki Asano)

In this scenario, even though each account has a single owner, Account 9 presents an edge case with an enormous high balance, testing if the system properly handles such financially significant account values, often rare but plausible in inheritance situations or business contexts.

- **Use Association**
  - **Account 8** is used by:
    - **Person L** (Haruto Tanaka)
    - **Person M** (Yuki Asano)

  - **Account 9** is used by:
    - **Person L** (Haruto Tanaka)

This configuration shows intergenerational account usage. An older person might assist a younger one in account management or vice versa, common in trust-based family handling scenarios prevalent in Japanese family structures.

- **AccountOfBanks Composition**
  - Both accounts (Account 8 and Account 9) are held within **Bank E** (Sakura Financial Group).

In this model, structural variety is emphasized by creating one dramatically high-balance account alongside a zero-balance account, honing in on the spectrum of possible account situations from zero activity to major financial holdings, contextualized within the Japanese financial landscape where extensive savings are culturally valued and multi-generational financial interactions are typical." }] }

### Explanation:

- **Bank**: Maple Leaf Financial operates in Canada, highlighting North American banking customs and a diverse cultural backdrop.

- **Accounts**: Four accounts display a variety of balances and purposes:
  - Account 1 holds significant funds for likely major investments or savings strategies.
  - Account 2 exhibits a zero balance, possibly denoting a recently set-up account or one nearing closure.
  - Account 3 features a moderate balance, likely intended for everyday transactions.
  - Account 4, with a minimal balance, reflects either a new start or a just-maintained presence.

- **People**: Four individuals with different cultural backgrounds and life stages provide a nuanced portrayal:
  - Sarah, an experienced individual, juggles ownership and usage across multiple accounts, manifesting active economic participation.
  - Raj, younger, co-owns and uses accounts indicating initial financial strategies and learning.
  - Mei, managing multiple accounts, shows balanced financial planning and multi-faceted engagement.
  - Michael, engaging jointly, hints at coherent teamwork or partnership in personal finance.

- **Relationships**:
  - Accounts range from solely owned, distinctly used (Mei, Account 3) to complex shared ownership and use scenarios (Accounts 1, 2, and 4).
  - This mix covers cases of reserved personal accounts and interconnected financial systems where usage rights overlap or are delegated, reflecting varied real-world banking arrangements often seen in families or among close professional collaborations." }] }

  - Rafael Silva is the sole owner of a tech business account with IBAN `BR5609876543210987654321098`, which he uses to manage his growing online entrepreneurship efforts.

- **Use of Accounts**:
  - Pedro Lopez is authorized to use the family account for educational expenses and personal purchasing, though he does not officially co-own it, challenging the **AdultOwners** constraint.
  - Rafael Silva utilizes his business account exclusively for his online transactions and supplier payments, despite currently facing a negative balance.

- **Bank Association**:
  - Both accounts are under the management of Horizonte Bank, illustrating a mixture of traditional family savings and modern entrepreneurial ventures.

### Constraint Violations

This instance sheds light on the **positiveBalance** invariant breach with Rafael's account running a temporary deficit, a common occurrence in startup environments where expenses may precede revenues. Furthermore, Pedro's access to the family account underscores a limitation with the current model’s constraints on minor usage permissions. Such scenarios enforce the real-life requirement for the model to consider practical elements like authorized minor usage and the typical cash flow management dynamics of small business accounts." }] }

  - **BIC**: SBCOKNNAXXX

### Accounts
1. **Account 10**
   - **IBAN**: KE8888888888888888
   - **Balance**: 1

2. **Account 11**
   - **IBAN**: KE9999999999999999
   - **Balance**: 250000

### Persons

  - **First Name**: Achieng
  - **Last Name**: Odhiambo
  - **Age**: 19

- **Person O**

  - **Last Name**: Kibet
  - **Age**: 55

- **Person P**

This group represents a range of ages and cultural backgrounds, shaping diverse and rich interactions with bank accounts, from young adulthood exploring financial independence to mature stages of financial stewardship.

### Relationships
- **Ownership Association**

    - **Person N** (Achieng Odhiambo)
    - **Person O** (Kiprono Kibet)

  - **Account 11** is owned by:

This instance shows a multi-cultural ownership setup where Account 10 is jointly owned by a very young adult and a middle-aged adult, supporting potential mentoring dynamics. Account 11 is fully controlled by a senior, illustrating potential generational wealth management or pensions.

- **Use Association**
  - **Account 10** is used by:
    - **Person N** (Achieng Odhiambo)
    - **Person P** (Isingoma Mukasa)

  - **Account 11** is used by:

These relationships demonstrate how accounts may be accessed and used across different age groups and user connections, reflecting behavior where usage permissions extend beyond direct ownership typically seen in cooperative financial contexts like shared family responsibilities or educational roles.
